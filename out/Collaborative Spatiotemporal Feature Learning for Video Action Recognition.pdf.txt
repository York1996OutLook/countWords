Abstract

Spatiotemporal feature learning is of central importance
for action recognition in videos. Existing deep neural net-
work models either learn spatial and temporal features in-
dependently (C2D) or jointly with unconstrained parame-
ters (C3D). In this paper, we propose a novel neural op-
eration which encodes spatiotemporal features collabora-
tively by imposing a weight-sharing constraint on the learn-
able parameters.
In particular, we perform 2D convolu-
tion along three orthogonal views of volumetric video data,
which learns spatial appearance and temporal motion cues
respectively. By sharing the convolution kernels of dif-
ferent views, spatial and temporal features are collabora-
tively learned and thus beneﬁt from each other. The com-
plementary features are subsequently fused by a weighted
summation whose coefﬁcients are learned end-to-end. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-
scale benchmarks and won the 1st place in the Moments
in Time Challenge 2018. Moreover, based on the learned
coefﬁcients of different views, we are able to quantify the
contributions of spatial and temporal features. This analy-
sis sheds light on interpretability of the model and may also
guide the future design of algorithm for video recognition.

1. Introduction

Recently, video action recognition has drawn increasing
attention considering its potential in a wide range of appli-
cations such as video surveillance, human-computer inter-
action and social video recommendation. The key to this
task lies in joint spatiotemporal feature learning. The spa-
tial feature mainly describes appearance of objects involved
in an action and the scene conﬁguration as well within each
frame of the video. Spatial feature learning is analogous
to that of still image recognition, and thus easily beneﬁts
from the recent advancements brought by deep Convolu-
tional Neural Networks (CNN) [13]. While the tempo-
ral feature captures motion cues embedded in the evolving
frames over time. There are two challenges that arise. One
is how to learn the temporal feature. The other is how to

properly fuse spatial and temporal features.

The ﬁrst attempt of researchers is to model temporal mo-
tion information explicitly and in parallel to spatial informa-
tion. Raw frames and optical ﬂow between adjacent frames
are exploited as two input streams of a deep neural net-
work [23, 6]. On the other hand, as a generalization of 2D
ConvNets (C2D) for still image recognition, 3D ConvNets
(C3D) are proposed to tackle 3D volumetric video data [24].
In C3D, spatial and temporal features are closely entangled
and jointly learned. That is, rather than learning spatial and
temporal features separately and fusing them at the top of
the network, joint spatiotemporal features are learned by
3D convolutions distributed over the whole network. Con-
sidering the excellent feature representation learning capa-
bility of CNN, ideally C3D should achieve great success on
video understanding just as C2D does on image recogni-
tion. However, the huge number of model parameters and
computational inefﬁciency limit the effectiveness and prac-
ticality of C3D.

In this paper, we propose a novel Collaborative Spa-

tioTemporal (CoST) feature learning operation, which
learns spatiotemporal features jointly with a weight-sharing
constraint. Given a 3D volumetric video tensor, we ﬂatten
it into three sets of 2D images by viewing it from different
angles. Then 2D convolution is applied to each set of 2D
images. Figure 1 shows the 2D snapshots from three views
of an exemplary video clip, where a man is high jumping at
the stadium. View of H-W is the natural view with which
human beings are familiar. By scanning the video frame
by frame from this view over time T , we are able to un-
derstand the video content. Although snapshots from views
involving T (i.e. T -W and T -H) are difﬁcult to interpret for
human beings, they contain exactly the same amount of in-
formation as the normal H-W view. More importantly, rich
motion information is embedded within each frame rather
than between frames. Hence 2D convolutions on frames of
the T -W and T -H views are able to capture temporal mo-
tion cues directly. As shown in Figure 2(c), by fusing com-
plementary spatial and temporal features of the three views,
we are able to learn spatiotemporal features using 2D con-
volutions rather than 3D convolutions.

Notably, the convolution kernels of different views are
shared for the following reasons. 1) From the visualization
of the frames of different views (see Figure 1), their visual
appearances are compatible. For example, common spatial
patterns such as edges and color blobs also exist in tempo-
ral views (T -H and T -W ). Hence, the same set of convo-
lution kernels can be applied on frames of different views.
2) Convolution kernels in C2D networks are inherently re-
dundant without pruning [9, 15, 31]. While the redundant
kernels can be exploited for temporal feature learning by
means of weight sharing. 3) The number of model param-
eters is greatly reduced, such that the network is easier to
train and less prone to overﬁtting, resulting in better per-
formance. Besides, the success of spatial feature learning
on still images (e.g. carefully designed network architecture
and pre-trained parameters) can be transferred to temporal
domain with little effort.

The complementary features of different views are fused
by a weighted summation. We learn an independent co-
efﬁcient for each channel in each view, which allows the

network to attend to either spatial or temporal features on
demand. Moreover, based on the learned coefﬁcients, we
are able to quantify the respective contributions of spatial
domain and temporal domain.

Based on the CoST operation, we build a convolutional
neural network. We will henceforth refer to both the opera-
tion and the network as CoST, which should be easy to iden-
tify according to its context. Compared with C2D, CoST
can learn spatiotemporal features jointly. While compared
with C3D, CoST is based on 2D rather than 3D convolu-
tions. CoST essentially bridges the gap between C2D and
C3D, where the beneﬁts from both sides, i.e. compactness
of C2D and representation capability of C3D are retained.
For the task of action recognition in videos, experiments
show that CoST achieves superior performance over both
C2D and C3D.

The main contributions of this work are summarized as

follows:

• We propose CoST, which collaboratively learns spa-
tiotemporal features using 2D convolutions rather than
3D convolutions.

• To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work on
quantitative analysis of importance of spatial and tem-
poral features for video understanding.

• The proposed CoST model outperforms the conven-
tional C3D model and its variants, achieving state-of-
the-art performance on large-scale benchmarks.

2. Related Work

In the early stage, hand-crafted representations have
been well explored for video action recognition. Many
feature descriptors for 2D images are generalized to 3D
spatiotemporal domain, e.g. Space-Time Interest Points
(STIP) [14], SIFT-3D [21], Spatiotemporal SIFT [1] and
3D Histogram of Gradient [12]. The most successful hand-
crafted representations are dense trajectories [27] and its
improved version [28], which extract local features along
trajectories guided by optical ﬂow.

Encouraged by the great success of deep learning, espe-
cially the CNN model for image understanding, there are a
number of attempts to develop deep learning methods for
action classiﬁcation [33]. The two-stream architecture [23]
utilizes visual frames and optical ﬂows between adjacent
frames as two separate inputs of the network, and fuses
their output classiﬁcation scores as the ﬁnal prediction.
Many works follow and extend this architecture [5, 6, 34].
The LSTM networks have also been employed to capture
temporal dynamics and long range dependences in videos.
In [18, 4] CNN is used to learn spatial feature for each
frame, while LSTM is used to model temporal evolutions.

More recently, with the increasing computing capability
of modern GPUs and the availability of large-scale video
datasets, 3D ConvNet (C3D) has drawn more and more at-
tention. In [24] a 11-layer C3D model is designed to jointly
learn spatiotemporal features on the Sports-1M dataset [11].
However, the huge computational cost and the dense param-
eters of C3D make it infeasible to train a very deep model.
Qiu et al. [19] proposed Pseudo-3D (P3D) which decom-
poses a 3D convolution of 3 × 3 × 3 into a 2D convolution
of 1 × 3 × 3 followed by a 1D convolution of 3 × 1 × 1. In
another work [25], similar architecture is explored and re-
ferred to as (2+1)D. [2] proposed the Inﬂated 3D ConvNet
(I3D), which is exactly C3D whose parameters are initial-
ized by inﬂating the parameters of pre-trained C2D model.
The most closely related work to ours is Slicing
CNN [22], which also learns features from multiple views
for crowd video understanding. However, there are sub-
stantial differences between Slicing CNN and the proposed
CoST. Slicing CNN learns independent features of the
three views via three different network branches, which are
merged at the top of the network. Aggregation of spatial
and temporal features is conducted only once at the network
level. On the contrary, we learn spatiotemporal features col-
laboratively using a novel CoST operation. Spatiotemporal
feature aggregation is conducted layer-wise.

3. Method

In this section, we ﬁrst review the conventional C2D and
C3D architectures, which are implemented as a baseline.
Then we introduce the proposed CoST. The connection and
comparison between CoST and C2D / C3D are also dis-
cussed.

work, we implement C2D as a baseline model. We choose
ResNets [8] as our backbone networks, whose residual unit
is shown in Figure 3(a). To handle 3D volumetric video
data, the vanilla ResNets need to be adapted accordingly.
Taking ResNet-50 as an example, its adapted version for
video action recognition is illustrated in Table 1. For con-
venience we will henceforth refer to it as ResNet-50-C2D.
Note the differences between ResNet-50-C2D and vanilla
ResNet-50. Firstly, all k × k 2D convolutions are adapted to
their 3D form, i.e. 1 × k × k. Secondly, a temporal pooling
(pool2) is append after block1 to halve the number of frames
from 8 to 4. Thirdly, the global average pooling (pool3) is
also adapted from 7 × 7 to 4 × 7 × 7 such that spatial and
temporal features are aggregated simultaneously. Similarly,
we can setup ResNet-101-C2D based on ResNet-101.

3.2. 3D ConvNets

C3D is a natural generalization of C2D for 3D video
data. In C3D, 2D convolutions are converted to 3D by in-
ﬂating the ﬁlters from square to cubic. For example, an
h × w 2D ﬁlter can be converted into a t × h × w 3D ﬁlter
by introducing an additional temporal dimension t [5, 2].
In modern deep CNN architectures like ResNets, there are
two main types of ﬁlters, i.e. 1 × 1 and 3 × 3. As ex-
plored in [30], given a residual unit comprised of 1 × 1 and
3 × 3 convolutions, we may either inﬂate the middle 3 × 3
ﬁlter into 3 × 3 × 3 (C3D3×3×3) as shown in Figure 3(b),
or inﬂate the ﬁrst 1 × 1 ﬁlter into 3 × 1 × 1 (C3D3×1×1)
as shown in Figure 3(c). Experiments in [30] demonstrate
that C3D3×3×3 and C3D3×1×1 achieve comparable perfor-
mance, while the latter contains much fewer parameters and

7874

is more computationally efﬁcient. Therefore, in our imple-
mentation, C3D3×1×1 is adopted and referred to as C3D for
simplicity. Notably, the C3D3×1×1 model learns spatial and
temporal features alternatively rather than jointly, which is
very similar to the (2+1)D [25] and P3D [19] models.

In our implementation, we inﬂate the ﬁrst 1 × 1 ﬁlter for
every two residual units following [30]. However, we leave
conv1 unchanged to be 2D (1 × 7 × 7), as opposed to [30].

3.3. CoST

In this section, we elaborately describe the proposed
CoST model. Figure 2 compares the proposed CoST oper-
ation to common spatiotemporal feature aggregating mod-
ules. As mentioned above, C3D3×3×3 utilizes a 3D convo-
lution of 3 × 3 × 3 to extract spatial (along H and W ) and
temporal (along T ) features jointly. In the C3D3×1×1 con-
ﬁguration, a 1D 3 × 1 × 1 convolution along T is utilized
to aggregate temporal feature, followed by a 2D 1 × 3 × 3
convolution along H and W for spatial feature. While in
the proposed method, we perform 2D 3 × 3 convolutions
along three views of the T × H × W volumetric data, i.e.
H-W , T -H and T -W separately. Notably, the parameters
of the three-view convolutions are shared, which keeps the
number of parameters the same as single-view 2D convo-
lution. The three resulting feature maps are subsequently
aggregated with weighted summation. The weights are also
learned during training in an end-to-end manner.

Let x denote the input feature maps of size T × H ×
W × C1 where C1 is the number of input channels. The
three sets of output feature maps from different views are
computed by:

xhw = x ⊗ w1×3×3,

xtw = x ⊗ w3×1×3,

xth = x ⊗ w3×3×1,

(1)

where ⊗ denotes 3D convolution, w is convolution ﬁlters
of size 3 × 3 shared among the three views. To apply w to
frames of different views, we insert an additional dimension
of size 1 at different indices. The resulting variants of w, i.e.
w1×3×3, w3×1×3 and w3×3×1 learn features of the H-W ,
T -W and T -H views respectively. Then, the three sets of
feature maps are aggregated with weighted summation:

where α = [αhw, αtw, αth] are the coefﬁcients of size

three views. To avoid magnitude explosion of the resulting
responses from multiple views, α is normalized with the
Softmax function along each row.

Figure 5. Architecture of CoST(b), where the coefﬁcients α are
predicted by the network.

To learn the coefﬁcients α, we propose two architec-

tures, named CoST(a) and CoST(b).
CoST(a). As illustrated in Figure 4, the coefﬁcients α are
considered as part of the model parameters, which can be
updated with back-propagation during training. During in-
ference, the coefﬁcients are ﬁxed and the same set of coef-
ﬁcients is applied to each video clip.
CoST(b). The coefﬁcients α are predicted by the network
based on the feature maps by which α will be multiplied.
This design is inspired by the recent self-attention [26]
mechanism for machine translation.
In this case, the co-
efﬁcients for each sample depend on the sample itself. It
can be formulated as:

(cid:2)αhw, αtw, αth(cid:3) = f ((cid:2)xhw, xtw, xth(cid:3))

(3)

The architecture of CoST(b) is illustrated in Figure 5. The
computational block inside the dashed lines represents the
function f in Equation (3). Speciﬁcally, for each view, we
ﬁrst reduce the feature map from a size of T × H × W × C2
to 1 × 1 × 1 × C2 using global max pooling along dimen-
sion T , H and W . Then, a 1 × 1 × 1 convolution is applied
on the pooled features, whose weights are also shared by all

three views. This convolution maps features of dimension
C2 back to C2, which captures the contextual information
among channels. After that, the three sets of features are
concatenated and fed into a fully connected (FC) layer. As
opposed to the 1 × 1 × 1 convolution, this FC layer is ap-
plied to each row of the C2 × 3 matrix, which captures the
contextual information among different views. Finally, we
normalize the output by the Softmax function.

The residual unit of the proposed CoST is shown in Fig-
ure 3(d). We replace the middle 3 × 3 convolution with our
CoST operation, either CoST(a) or CoST(b), and leave the
preceding 1 × 1 convolution unchanged. Based on the C2D
conﬁguration of ResNets, we build CoST by replacing the
C2D unit with the proposed CoST unit for every two resid-
ual units, which is consistent to C3D.

3.4. Connection to C2D and C3D

The proposed CoST is closely related to C2D and C3D.
As shown in Figure 6(a), if the coefﬁcients of the T -W and
T -W views were set to zero, CoST degenerates to C2D.
Hence, CoST is a strict generalization of C2D.

To compare CoST with C3D, let us exclude the dimen-
sions of input and output channels for simplicity. 3D con-
volution with a kernel size of k × k × k contains k3 pa-
rameters and covers a cubic receptive ﬁeld of k3 voxels.
While the proposed CoST operation covers an irregular re-
ceptive ﬁeld of 3k2
− 3k + 1 voxels. Figure 6(b) shows a
comparison of receptive ﬁeld when k is equal to 3. C3D
covers the whole 3 × 3 × 3 cube, while CoST covers the
shaded region excluding the 8 corner voxels.
If the con-
volution kernels of the three views are learned separately
without weight sharing, CoST is nearly equivalent to C3D
except that the 8 corner parameters of the cubic kernel are
ﬁxed to zero and not learnable. When weight sharing is
enabled in CoST, although the receptive ﬁeld contains 19
voxels in total, the corresponding 19 parameters can be de-
rived from the 9 learnable parameters shared among differ-
ent views. Therefore, CoST can be considered as a special
case of C3D, where similar receptive ﬁeld is covered with
signiﬁcantly reduced number of parameters.

In terms of computational cost, CoST is also superior

over C3D. The number of multiply-adds involved in the
CoST operation is approximately 3k2 (excluding input and
output channels), while that of C3D is k3. Computational
cost of CoST increases quadratically with the kernel size
rather than cubically. This characteristic makes the employ-
ment of large kernel possible, which has not been explored
yet on video data. Moreover, for the CoST(a) variant, some
voxels in the receptive ﬁeld are duplicately computed by
multiple views in our current implementation. With an op-
timized implementation, the number of multiply-adds can
be reduced from 3k2 to 3k2
− 3k + 1, e.g. from 27 to 19
(save ∼ 30%) for the case of k = 3.

4. Experiments

To validate the effectiveness of the proposed CoST for
the task of action recognition in videos, we perform ex-
tensively experiments on two of the largest benchmark
datasets, i.e. Moments in Time [17] and Kinetics [2]. Ac-
curacies are measured on the validation set of both datasets
in all experiments.

4.1. Datasets

Moments in Time. The Moments in Time dataset contains
802245 training videos and 39900 validation videos from
339 action categories. The videos are trimmed such that the
duration is about 3 seconds.
Kinetics. The Kinetics dataset contains 236763 training
videos and 19095 validation videos, which are annotated
as one of 400 human action categories. Note that the full
Kinetics dataset contains a bit more samples. The numbers
only cover the samples we are able to download. The dura-
tion of the videos is about 10 seconds.

4.2. Implementation Details

During training, we ﬁrst sample 64 continuous frames
from a video and then sub-sample one frame for every 8
frames, resulting in 8 frames in total. Next, image patches
with a size of 224 × 224 pixels are randomly cropped from
a scaled video whose shorter side is randomly sampled be-
tween 256 and 320 pixels. Hence, the network input is of
dimension 8 × 224 × 224. In all experiments, our models
are initialized from ImageNet [20] pre-trained 2D models.
We train the models on an 8-GPU machine. To speedup
training, the 8 GPUs are grouped into two workers and the
weights are updated asynchronously between the two work-
ers. Each GPU process a mini-batch of 8 video clips. That
is, for each worker 4 GPUs are employed, resulting in a total
mini-batch size of 32. We train the models for 600k itera-
tions using the SGD optimizer with momentum. We use a
momentum of 0.9 and a weight decay of 0.0001. The learn-
ing rate is initialized to 0.005 and reduced by a factor of 10
at 300k and 450k iterations respectively.

ing ResNet-50 as the backbone.

During inference, following [30] we perform spatially
fully convolutional inference on videos whose shorter side
is rescaled to 256 pixels. While for the temporal domain, we
sample 10 clips evenly from a full-length video and com-
pute their classiﬁcation scores individually. The ﬁnal pre-
diction is the averaged score of all clips.

4.3. Ablation Studies

To validate the effectiveness of individual components
of our approach, we perform ablation studies on coefﬁ-
cient learning, impact of collaborative spatiotemporal fea-
ture learning and improvements of CoST over C2D and
C3D.

4.3.1 Coefﬁcient Learning

We ﬁrst compare the performance of the two CoST vari-
ants for coefﬁcient learning of different views. As shown
in Table 2, on both of the Moments in Time and Kinetics
datasets, coefﬁcients predicted by the network (CoST(b))
outperform those learned as model parameters (CoST(a)).
This result veriﬁes the effectiveness of the self-attention
mechanism introduced in our model.
It also reveals that
for different video clips, the importance of spatial and tem-
poral features varies. Henceforth, the CoST(b) architecture
is adopted in the following experiments.

4.3.2

Impact of Collaborative Feature Learning

To validate the effectiveness of collaborative spatiotemporal
feature learning through weight sharing, we compare the re-
sults of the CoST(b) network with and without weight shar-
ing. When weight sharing is disabled, the parameters of the
three convolutional layers in Figure 5 are learned indepen-
dently such that spatiotemporal features are learned in a de-
coupled manner. As listed in Table 3, with weight sharing
among different views, accuracies get improved by about
1% on both datasets. This result shows that our analysis on
the characteristics of the three spatial and temporal views in
Section 1 is reasonable and their collaborative feature learn-
ing is beneﬁcial.

Improvements over C2D and C3D

To compare CoST with the C2D and C3D baselines,
we train all the three networks using the same protocol.
Their performances on the Moments in Time and Kinet-
ics datasets are listed in Table 4 and Table 5 respectively.
We can see that C3D is far better than C2D, while CoST
consistently outperforms C3D by about 1%, which clearly
demonstrates the superiority of CoST. Note that the perfor-
mance of C3D with ResNet-50 backbone is on par with the
proposed CoST without weight sharing (see Table 3), which
validates the connection between CoST and C3D described
in Section 3.4.

4.4. Comparisons with the State of the arts

Besides the 8-frame model, we also train a model with a
higher temporal resolution, i.e. 32 frames. On Moments in
time, the 32 input frames are sampled from 64 continuous
frames mentioned earlier. While on Kinetics, we sample 32

in this dataset is longer than those in Moments in Time.
The 32-frame model is ﬁne-tuned from the 8-frame model,
where the parameters of BN layers [10] are frozen.

On the Moments in Time dataset, Table 7 shows a com-
parison of the proposed CoST with existing methods. CoST
improves the ResNet-50 C2D baseline reported in [17] by
2.9% and 5.5% in terms of top-1 and top-5 accuracies re-
spectively. While ResNet-101 based CoST with 32 input
frames achieves 32.4% top-1 accuracy and 60.0% top-5 ac-
curacy. Notably, based on the RGB modality only, our
model outperforms the ensemble result of multiple modal-
ities (i.e. RGB, optical ﬂow and audio) in [17] by a large
margin. With an ensemble of multiple models and modal-
ities, we achieve 52.91% average accuracy on the test set,
which won the 1st place in the Moments in Time Challenge
2018.

advantage over C3D [7] and its variants, e.g. I3D [2],
R(2+1)D [25] and S3D-G [32].
Compared with NL
I3D [30], which is a strong baseline, CoST is also superior
at various temporal resolutions.

4.5. Importance of Different Views

By investigating the magnitude of the learned coefﬁ-
cients, we are able to quantify the contribution of different
views. Speciﬁcally, for each CoST layer, the mean coefﬁ-
cient of each view is computed on the validation set. The
mean coefﬁcient of the H-W view measures the importance
of appearance feature, while those of the T -W and T -H
views measure the importance of temporal motion cues.

The overall importance of each view can be measured
by averaging the mean coefﬁcients of all CoST layers. On
Moments in Time, the mean coefﬁcients of the H-W , T -W
and T -H views are 0.67, 0.14 and 0.19 respectively. While
on Kinetics they are 0.77, 0.08 and 0.15. Hence, spatial
feature plays a major role on both datasets. And the Mo-
ments in Time dataset depends more on temporal feature to
discriminate different actions than Kinetics.

Figure 8 shows the coefﬁcient distribution among the
three views in all CoST layers of the ResNet-50 based
CoST. From shallow layer to deep layer, a clear trend is
observed on both datasets. That is, the contribution of spa-
tial feature declines, while that of temporal feature rises. In
other words, the closer to top of a network, the more impor-
tant the temporal feature is, suggesting that the model tends
to learn temporal feature based on high-level spatial feature.
This also veriﬁes the conclusion in [32] that temporal rep-
resentation learning on high-level semantic features is more
useful than low-level features.

On the Kinetics dataset, CoST achieves state-of-the-art
performance. As shown in Table 6, CoST has a clear

Furthermore, we analyze the importance of spatial and
temporal features for each action category on the Moments

in Time dataset. We sum up the mean coefﬁcients of tem-
poral related views and sort all categories by it. As shown
in Figure 7, for actions such as erupting, storming, over-
ﬂowing, combusting and landing, temporal motion infor-
mation is very important. On the contrary, for actions such
as baptizing, handcufﬁng / arresting, interviewing, buying
and paying, temporal feature is less important. These ac-
tions can either be easily recognized by appearance, or the
temporal evolutions are not very helpful for classiﬁcation.
For example, for buying and interviewing various motion
patterns exist within the same category and they may be
easily confused between different actions, which makes the
motion cues not discriminative.

In summary, with the proposed CoST, we are able to
quantitatively analyze the importance of spatial and tempo-
ral features. In particular, we observe that the bottom layers
of the network focus more on spatial feature learning, while
the top layers attend more to temporal feature aggregation.
Besides, some actions are easier to recognize based on the
underlying objects and their interactions (e.g. geometric re-
lation) rather than motion cues. This indicates that the cur-
rent spatiotemporal feature learning approaches may not be
optimal, and we expect more efforts on this problem.

For video analysis, how to encode spatiotemporal fea-
tures effectively and efﬁciently is still an open question. In
this work, we propose to use weight-shared 2D convolutions
for simultaneous spatial and temporal feature encoding. Al-
though we empirically verify that weight sharing brings per-
formance gain, one big question behind is whether the tem-
poral dimension T can be cast as a normal spatial dimension
(like depth) or not. Intuitively, spatial appearance feature
and temporal motion cue belong to two different modalities
of information. What motivates us to learn them collabo-
ratively is the visualization of different views as shown in
Figure 1. Interestingly, our positive results indicate that at
least to some extent, they share similar characteristics and
can be jointly learned using a single network with identi-
cal network architecture and shared convolution kernels. In
physics, according to Minkowski spacetime [16], the three-
dimensional space and one-dimensional time can be uniﬁed
as a four-dimensional continuum. Our ﬁnding might be ex-
plained and supported by the spacetime model in the context
of feature representation learning.

6. Conclusion

Feature learning from 3D volumetric data is the ma-
jor challenge for action recognition in videos. In this pa-
per, we propose a novel feature learning operation, which
learns spatiotemporal features collaboratively from multi-
ple views. It can be easily used as a drop-in replacement for
C2D and C3D. Experiments on large-scale benchmarks val-
idate the superiority of the proposed architecture over exist-
ing methods. Based on the learned coefﬁcients of different
views, we are able to take a peek at the individual contri-
bution of spatial and temporal features for classiﬁcation. A
systematic analysis indicates some promising directions on
the design of algorithm, which we will leave as future work.
