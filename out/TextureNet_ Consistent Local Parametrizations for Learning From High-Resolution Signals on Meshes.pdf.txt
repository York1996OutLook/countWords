Figure 1: TextureNet takes as input a 3D textured mesh. The mesh is parameterized with a consistent 4-way rotationally
symmetric (4-RoSy) ﬁeld, which is used to extract oriented patches from the texture at a set of sample points. Networks of
4-RoSy convolutional operators extract features from the patches and used for 3D semantic segmentation.

Abstract

We introduce, TextureNet, a neural network architec-
ture designed to extract features from high-resolution sig-
nals associated with 3D surface meshes (e.g., color texture
maps). The key idea is to utilize a 4-rotational symmetric (4-
RoSy) ﬁeld to deﬁne a domain for convolution on a surface.
Though 4-RoSy ﬁelds have several properties favorable for
convolution on surfaces (low distortion, few singularities,
consistent parameterization, etc.), orientations are ambigu-
ous up to 4-fold rotation at any sample point. So, we intro-
duce a new convolutional operator invariant to the 4-RoSy
ambiguity and use it in a deep network to extract features
from high-resolution signals on geodesic neighborhoods of
a surface. In comparison to alternatives, such as PointNet-
based methods which lack a notion of orientation, the co-
herent structure given by these neighborhoods results in sig-
niﬁcantly stronger features. As an example application, we
demonstrate the beneﬁts of our architecture for 3D semantic
segmentation of textured 3D meshes. The results show that
our method outperforms all existing methods on the basis
of mean IoU by a signiﬁcant margin in both geometry-only
(6.4%) and RGB+Geometry (6.9-8.2%) settings.

1. Introduction

In recent years, there has been tremendous progress in
RGB-D scanning methods that allow reliable tracking and

reconstruction of 3D surfaces using hand-held, consumer-
grade devices [8, 18, 27, 28, 41, 21, 11]. Though these
methods are now able to reconstruct high-resolution tex-
tured 3D meshes suitable for visualization, understanding
the 3D semantics of the scanned scenes is still a relatively
open research problem.

There has been a lot of recent work on semantic seg-
mentation of 3D data using convolutional neural networks
(CNNs). Typically, features extracted from the scanned in-
puts (e.g., positions, normals, height above ground, colors,
etc.) are projected onto a coarse sampling of 3D locations,
and then a network of 3D convolutional ﬁlters is trained to
extract features for semantic classiﬁcation – e.g., using con-
volutions over voxels [42, 25, 30, 36, 9, 13], octrees [33],
point clouds [29, 31], or mesh vertices [24]. The advantage
of these approaches over 2D image-based methods is that
convolutions operate directly on 3D data, and thus are rel-
atively unaffected by view-dependent image effects, such
as perspective, occlusion, lighting, and background clut-
ter. However, the resolution of current 3D representations
is generally quite low (2cm is typical), and so the ability
of 3D CNNs to discriminate ﬁne-scale semantic patterns is
usually far below their color image counterparts [23, 16].

To address this issue, we propose a new convolutional
neural network, TextureNet, that extracts features directly
from high-resolution signals associated with 3D surface
meshes. Given a map that associates high-resolution sig-
nals with a 3D mesh surface (e.g., RGB photographic tex-

4440

ture), we deﬁne convolutional ﬁlters that operate on those
signals within domains deﬁned by geodesic surface neigh-
borhoods. This approach combines the advantages of fea-
ture extraction from high-resolution signals (as in [10]) with
the advantages of view-independent convolution on 3D sur-
face domains (as in [39]). This combination is important for
the example in labeling the chair in Figure 1, whose surface
fabric is easily recognizable in a color texture map.

During our investigation of this approach, we had to ad-
dress several research issues, the most signiﬁcant of which
is how to deﬁne on geodesic neighborhoods of a mesh. One
approach could be to compute a global UV parameterization
for the entire surface and then deﬁne convolutional opera-
tors directly in UV space; however, that approach may in-
duce signiﬁcant deformations due to ﬂattening, not always
follow surface features, and/or produce seams at surface
cuts. Another approach could be to compute UV param-
eterizations for local neighborhoods independently; how-
ever, then adjacent neighborhoods might not be oriented
consistently, reducing the ability of a network to properly
learn orientation-dependent features. Instead, we compute
a 4-RoSy (four-fold rotationally symmetric) ﬁeld on the sur-
face using QuadriFlow [17] and deﬁne a new 4-RoSy con-
volutional operator that explicitly accounts for the 4-fold
rotational ambiguity of the cross ﬁeld parameterization. A
4-RoSy (four-way rotationally symmetric) ﬁeld is a conﬁg-
uration of 4 orthogonal tangent directions associated with
each vertex in the shape of a cross that varies smoothly over
the mesh surface. Since the 4-RoSy ﬁeld from QuadriFlow
has no seams, aligns to shape features, induces relatively lit-
tle distortion, has few singularities, and consistently orients
adjacent neighborhoods (up to 4-way rotations), it provides
an attractive trade-off between distortion and orientation in-
variance.

Results on 3D semantic segmentation benchmarks show
an improvement of the 4-RoSy convolution on surfaces
over alternative geometry-only approaches (by 6.4%), plus
signiﬁcantly further improvement when applied to high-
resolution color signals (by 6.9-8.2% ). With ablation stud-
ies, we verify the importance of the consistent orientation
of a 4-RoSy ﬁeld and demonstrate that our sampling and
convolution operator works better than other alternatives.

Overall, our core research contributions are:
• a novel learning-based method for extracting features
from high-resolution signals living on surfaces embed-
ded in 3D, based on consistent local parameterizations,
• a new 4-RoSy convolutional operator designed for

cross ﬁelds on general surfaces in 3D,

• a new deep network architecture, TextureNet, com-

posed of 4-RoSy convolutional operators,

• an extensive experimental investigation of alternative
convolutional operators for semantic segmentation of
surfaces in 3D.

2. Related Work

3D Deep Learning. With the availability of 3D shape
databases [42, 7, 36] and real-world labeled 3D scanning
data [35, 1, 9, 6], there is signiﬁcant interest in deep learn-
ing on three-dimensional data. Early work developed CNNs
operating on 3D volumetric grids [42, 25]. They have been
used for 3D shape classiﬁcation [30, 33], semantic segmen-
tation [9, 13], object completion [12], and scene completion
[13]. More recently, researchers have developed methods
that can take a 3D point cloud as input to a neural net-
work and predict object classes or semantic point labels
[29, 31, 39, 37, 2]. AtlasNet [14] learns to generate sur-
faces of the 3D shape. In our work, we utilize a sparse point
sampled data representation, however, we exploit high res-
olution signals on geometric surface structures with a new
4-RoSy surface convolution kernel.

Convolutions on Meshes. Several researchers have pro-
posed methods for applying convolutional neural networks
intrinsically on manifold meshes. FeaStNet [40] proposes
a graph operator that establishes correspondences between
ﬁlter weights. Jiang et al. [20] applies differential operators
on unstructured spherical grids. GCNN [24] proposes using
discrete patch operators on tangent planes parameterized by
radius and angles. However, the orientation of their selected
geodesic patches is arbitrary, and the parameterization is
highly distorted or inconsistent at regions with high Gaus-
sian curvature. ACNN [3] observes this limitation and in-
troduces the anisotropic heat kernels derived from principal
curvatures. MoNet [26] further generalizes the architecture
with the learnable gaussian kernels for convolutions. The
principal curvature based frame selection method is adopted
by Xu et al. [43] for segmentation of nonrigid surfaces, by
Tatarchenko et al. [39] for semantic segmentation of point
clouds, and by ADD [4] for shape correspondence in the
spectral domain. It naturally removes orientation ambiguity
but fails to consider frame inconsistency problem, which is
critical when performing feature aggregation. Its problems
are particularly pronounced in indoor scenes (which often
have many planar regions where principal curvatures are
undetermined) and in real-world scans (which often have
noisy and uneven sampling where consistent principal cur-
vatures are difﬁcult to predict). In contrast, we deﬁne a 4-
RoSy ﬁeld that provides consistent orientations for neigh-
boring convolution domains.

Multi-view and 2D-3D Joint Learning. Other
re-
searchers have investigated how to incorporate features
from RGB inputs to 3D deep networks. The typical ap-
proach is to simply assign color values to voxels, points,
or mesh vertices and treat them as additional feature chan-
nels. However, given that geometry and RGB data are at
vastly different resolutions, this approach leads to signiﬁ-
cant downsampling of the color signal and thus does not

Figure 2: TextureNet architecture. We propose a UNet [34] architecture for hierarchical feature extraction. The key innova-
tion in the architecture is the texture convolution layer. We efﬁciently query the local geodesic patch for each surface point,
associating each neighborhood with a local, orientation-consistent texture coordinate system. This allows us to extract the
local 3D surface features as well as high-resolution signals such as associated RGB input.

take full advantage of the high-frequency patterns therein.
An alternative approach is to combine features extracted
from RGB images in a multi-view CNN [38]. This approach
has been used for 3D semantic segmentation in 3DMV [10],
where features are extracted from 2D RGB images and then
back-projected into a 3D voxel grid where they are merged
and further processed with 3D voxel convolutions. Like our
approach, 3DMV processes high-resolution RGB signals;
however it convolves them in a 2D image plane, where oc-
clusions and background clutter are confounding. In con-
trast, our method directly convolves high-resolution signals
intrinsically on the 3D surface which is view-independent.

3. The TextureNet Approach

Our approach performs convolutions on high-resolution
signals with geodesic convolutions directly on 3D surface
meshes. The input is a 3D mesh associated with a high-
resolution surface signal (e.g., a color texture map), and the
outputs are learned features for a dense set of sample points
that can be used for semantic segmentation and other tasks.
Our main contribution is deﬁning a smooth, consistently
oriented domain for surface convolutions based on four-
way rotationally symmetric (4-RoSy) ﬁelds. We observe
that 3D surfaces can be mapped with low-distortion to two-
dimensional parameterizations anchored at dense sample
points with locally consistent orientations and few singu-
larities if we allow for a four-way ambiguity in the orien-
tation at the sample points. We leverage that observation
in TextureNet by computing a 4-RoSy ﬁeld and point sam-
pling using QuadriFlow [17] and then building a network
using new 4-RoSy convolutional ﬁlters (TextureConv) that
are invariant to the four-way rotational ambiguity.

We utilize this network design to learn and extract fea-
tures from high-resolution signals on surfaces by extracting
surface patches with high-resolution signals oriented by the
4-RoSy ﬁeld at each sample point. The surface patches are
convolved by a few TextureConv layers, pooled at sample
points, and then convolved further with TextureConv lay-
ers in a UNet [34] architecture, as shown in ﬁgure 2. For

down-sampling and up-sampling, we use the furthest point
sampling and three-nearest neighbor interpolation method
proposed by PointNet++ [31]. The output of the network is
a set of features associated with point samples that can be
used for classiﬁcation and other tasks. The following sec-
tions describe the main components of the network in detail.

3.1. High Resolution Signal Representation

Our network takes as input a high-resolution signal as-
sociated with a 3D surface mesh. In the ﬁrst steps of pro-
cessing, it generates a set of sample points on the mesh
and deﬁnes a parameterized high-resolution patch for each
sample (Section 3.2) as follows: For each sample point
pi, we ﬁrst compute its geodesic neighborhood Ωρ(pi)
(Eq. 1) with radius ρ. Then, we sample an NxN point cloud
{qxy| − N/2 ≤ x, y < N/2}. The texture coordinates for
qxy are ((x + 0.5)d, (y + 0.5)d) – d is the distance between
the adjacent pixels in the texture patch. In practice, we se-
lect N = 10 and d = 4mm. Finally, we use our newly
proposed “TextureConv” and max-pooling operators (Sec-
tion 3.3) to extract the high-res feature fi for each point pi.

3.2. 4 RoSy Surface parameterization

A critical aspect of our network is to deﬁne a
consistently-oriented geodesic surface parameterization for
any position on a 3D mesh. Starting with some basic deﬁ-
nitions, for a sampled point p on the surface, we can locally
parameterize its tangent plane by two orthogonal tangent
vectors i and j. Also, for any point q on the surface, there
exists a shortest path on the surface connecting p and q,
e.g., the orange path in ﬁgure 3(a). By unfolding it to the
tangent plane, we can map q along the shortest path to q∗.
Using these constructs, we deﬁne the local texture coordi-
nate q in p’s neighborhood as

tp(q) = (cid:2)iT

jT (cid:3) (q∗ − p).

We additionally deﬁne the local geodesic neighborhood of
p with receptive ﬁeld ρ as

Ωρ(p) = {q | ||tp(q)||∞ < ρ}.

we can get the surface parameterization aligned with shape

images [15] result in high distortion in the orientation.

The selection for the set of mesh sampled positions {p}
and their tangent vectors i and j is critical for the success
of learning on a surface domain. Ideally, we would select
points whose spacing is uniform and whose tangent direc-
tions are consistently oriented at neighbors, such that the
underlying parameterization has no distortions or seams, as
shown in Figure 4(a). With those properties, we could learn
convolutional operators with translation invariance exactly
as we would for images. Unfortunately, these properties are
only achievable if the surface is a ﬂat plane. For a general
3D surface, we can only hope to select a set of point sam-
ples and tangent vectors that minimize deviations between
spacings of points and distortions of local surface parame-
terizations. Figure 4(b) shows an example where harmonic
surface parameterization introduces large-scale distortion –
a 2D convolution would include a large receptive ﬁeld at
the nose but a small one at the neck. Figure 4(c) shows a
geometry image [15] parameterization with high distortion
in the orientation – convolutions on such a map would have
randomly distorted and irregular receptive ﬁelds, making it
difﬁcult for a network to learn canonical features.

Unfortunately, a smoothly varying direction ﬁeld on the
surface is usually hard to obtain. According to the study of
the direction ﬁeld design [32, 22], the best-known approach
to mitigate the distortion is to compute a four-way rotation-
ally symmetric (4-RoSy) orientation ﬁeld, which minimizes
the deviation by incorporating directional ambiguity. Ad-
ditionally, the orientation ﬁeld needs a consistent deﬁnition
among different geometries, and the most intuitive way is to
make it align with the shape features like the principal cur-
vatures. Fortunately, the extrinsic energy is used by [19, 17]

Figure 5: Singularity at a cube vertex, (a)-(c) demonstrate
three different ways of unfolding the local neighborhood.
Such ambiguity is removed around the singularity by our
texture coordinate deﬁnition using the shortest path. For
the purple point, (a) is a valid neighborhood, while the blue
points in (b) and orange points in (c) are unfolded along the
paths which are not the shortest. Similarly, the ambiguity in
the gap location is removed.

to realize it. Therefore, we compute the extrinsic 4-Rosy
orientation ﬁeld at a uniform distribution of point samples
using QuadriFlow [17] and use it to deﬁne the tangent vec-
tors at any position on the surface. Because of the direc-
tional ambiguity, we randomly pick one direction from the
cross as i and compute j = n × i for any position.

Although there is a 4-way rotational ambiguity in this lo-
cal parameterization of the surface (which will be addressed
with a new convolutional operator in the next section), the
resulting 4-RoSy ﬁeld provides a way to extract geodesic
neighborhoods consistently across the entire surface, even
near singularities. Figure 5 (a,b,c) shows the ambiguity
of possible unfolded neighborhoods at a singularity. Since
QuadriFlow [17] treats singularities as faces rather than ver-
tices, all sampled positions have the well-deﬁned orienta-
tion ﬁeld. More importantly, the parameterization of ev-
ery geodesic neighborhood is well-deﬁned with our shortest
path patch parameterization. For example, only Figure 5(a)
is a valid parameterization for the purple spot, while the
location for the blue and orange spots in Figures 5(b) and
(c) are unfolded along the paths that are not the shortest.
Unfolding a geodesic neighborhood around the singularity
also causes another potential issue that a seam cut is usually
required, leading to a gap at the 3-singularity or multiple-
surface coverage at the 5-singularity. For example, there is
a gap at the bottom-right corner in Figure 5(a) caused by
the seam cut shown as the green dot line. Fortunately, the
location of the seam is also well-deﬁned with our shortest-
path deﬁnition:
it must be the shortest geodesic path go-
ing through the singularity. Therefore, our deﬁnition of the
local neighborhood guarantees a canonical way of surface
parameterization even around corners and singularities.

3.3. 4 RoSy Surface Convolution Operator

TextureNet is a network architecture composed of con-
volutional operators acting on geodesic neighborhoods of
sample points with 4-RoSy parameterizations. The input to
each convolutional layer is three-fold: 1) a set of 3D sample
points associated with features (e.g., RGB, normals, or fea-
tures computed from high-resolution surface patches or pre-

vious layers); 2) a coordinate system stored as two tangent
vectors representing the 4-RoSy cross ﬁeld for each point
sample; and 3) a coarse triangle mesh, where each face
is associated with the set of extracted sampled points and
connectivity indices that support fast geodesic patch query
and texture coordinate computation for the samples inside a
geodesic neighborhood, much like the PTex [5] representa-
tion for textures.

Our key contribution in this section is the design of a
convolution operator suitable for 4-RoSy ﬁelds. The prob-
lem is that we cannot use traditional 3x3 convolution ker-
nels on domains parameterized with 4-RoSy ﬁelds without
inducing inconsistent feature aggregation at higher levels.
Figure 6 demonstrates the problem for a simple example.
Figure 6(a) shows 3x3 convolution in a traditional ﬂat do-
main. Figure 6(b) shows the frames deﬁned by our 4-RoSy
orientation ﬁeld of the 3D cube where red spots represent
the singularities. Although the cross-ﬁeld in the orange
patch is consistent under the 4-RoSy metric, the frames
are not parallel when they are unfolded into a plane (ﬁg-
ure 6(c)). Aggregation of features inside such a patch is
therefore problematic.

“TextureConv” is our solution to remove the directional
ambiguity. It consists of four layers (in ﬁgure 2), including
geodesic patch search, texture space grouping, convolution
and aggregation. To extract the geodesic patch for each in-
put point Ωρ(p), we use breadth-ﬁrst search with the pri-
ority queue to extract the face set in the order of geodesic
distance from face center to p. We estimate the texture co-
ordinate at the face center as well as its local tangent coordi-
nate system, recorded as (tf , if , jf ). In order to expand the
search tree from face u to v, we can approximate the texture
coordinate at the face center as tv = tu+(iu, ju)T (cv−cu),
where cf represents the center position of the face f .
iv
and jv can be computed by rotating the coordinate system
around the shared edge from face u to v. After having the
face set inside the geodesic patch, we can ﬁnd the sampled
points set associated with these faces. We estimate the tex-
ture coordinate of every sampled point q associated with

each face f as tp(q) = tf + (if , jf )T (q − cf ). By test-
ing ||tp(q)||∞ < ρ, we can determine the sampled points
inside the geodesic patch Ωρ(p).

The texture space grouping layer segments the local
neighborhood into 3x3 patches in the texture space, each
of which is a square with edge length as 2ρ/3, as shown in
ﬁgure 2 (after the “grouping arrow”). We could directly bor-
row the image convolution method linearly transform each
point feature with 9 different weights according to their be-
longing patch. However, we propose a 4-RoSy convolution
kernel to deal with the directional ambiguity. As shown in
ﬁgure 2, all sampled points can be categorized as at the cor-
ners ({p1
j }). Each sam-
pled point feature is convolved with a 1x1 convolution as
h1, h2 or h3 based on its category. The extracted 4-rosy fea-
ture removes the ambiguity and allows higher-level feature
aggregation. The channel-wise aggregation operator g can
be max-pooling or average-pooling followed by the ReLu
layer.
In the task for semantic segmentation, we choose
max-pooling since it is better at preserving salient signals.

4. TextureNet Evaluation

To investigate the performance of TextureNet, we ran a
series of 3D semantic segmentation experiments for indoor
scenes. In all experiments, we train and test on the standard
splits of the ScanNet [9] and Matterport3D [9] datasets. Fol-
lowing previous works, we report mean class intersection-
over-union (mIoU) results for ScanNet and mean class ac-
curacy for Matterport3D.

Comparison to State-of-the-Art. Our main result is a
comparison of TextureNet to state-of-the-art methods for
3D semantic segmentation. For this experiment, all meth-
ods utilize both color and geometry in their native formats.
Speciﬁcally, PointNet++ [31], Tangent Convolution [39],
SplatNet [37] use points with per-point normals and colors;
3DMV [10] uses 2D image features back-projected onto
voxels; and Ours uses high-res 10x10 texture patches ex-
tracted from geodesic neighborhoods at sample points.

Table 1 reports the mean IoU scores for all 20 classes of
the ScanNet benchmark on the ScanNet (v2) and mean class
accuracy on Matterport3D datasets. They show that Tex-
tureNet (Ours) provides the best results on 18/20 classes for
Scannet and 12/20 classes for Matterport3D. Overall, the
mean class IoU for Ours is 8.2% higher than the previous
state-of-the-art (3DMV) on ScanNet (48.4% vs. 56.6%),
and our mean class accuracy is 6.9% higher on Matter-
port3D (56.1% vs. 63.0%).

Qualitative visual comparisons of the results shown in
Figures 7-9 suggest that the differences between methods
are often where high-resolution surface patterns are dis-
criminating (e.g., the curtain and pillows in the top row of
Figure 7) and where geodesic neighborhoods are more in-

bed). Figure 8 shows a case where convolutions with the
geodesic neighborhoods clearly outperform their Euclidean

counterparts. In Figure 8(b), part of the table is predicted
as chair, probably because it is in a Euclidean ball cover-
ing nearby chairs. This problem is solved with our method
based on geodesic patch neighborhoods. As shown in Fig-
ure 8(c), the table and the chairs are clearly segmented.

Effect of 4-RoSy Surface Parameterization. Our sec-
ond experiment is designed to test how different surface pa-
rameterizations affect semantic segmentation performance
– i.e., how does the choice of the orientation ﬁeld affect the
learning process? The simplest choice is to pick an arbi-
trary direction on the tangent plane as the x-axis, similar to
GCNN [24], (Figure 10(a)). A second option adopted by
Tangent Convolution [39] considers a set of points q in a
Euclidean ball centered at p and parameterizes the tangent

plane by two eigenvectors corresponding to the largest two
eigenvalues of the covariance matrix Pq(p − q)(p − q)T .
A critical problem of this formulation is that the princi-
pal directions cannot be robustly analyzed at planar re-
gions or noisy surfaces (Figure 10(b)). It also introduces
inconsistency to the coordinate systems of the neighbor-
ing points, which vexes the feature aggregation at higher
levels. A third alternative is to use the intrinsic energy
function [19] or other widely used direction ﬁeld synthesis
technique [32, 22], which is not geometry-aware and there-
fore variant to 3D rigid transformation (Figure 10(c)). Our
choice is to use the extrinsic energy to synthesize the di-
rection ﬁeld [17, 19], which is globally consistent and only
variant to geometry itself (Figure 10(d)).

To test the impact of this choice, we compare all of these
alternative direction ﬁelds to create the local neighborhood

parameterizations for our architecture and compare the re-
sults of 3D semantic segmentation on ScanNet (v1) test
set. As shown in Table 2, the choice for random direction
ﬁeld performs worst since it does not provide consistent pa-
rameterization. The tangent convolution suffers from the
same issue, but gets a better result since it aligns with the
shape features. The intrinsic parameterization aligns with
the shape features, but is not a canonical parameterization
– for example, different rigid transformations of the same
shape lead to different parameterizations. The extrinsic en-
ergy provides a canonical and consistent surface parame-
terization. As a result, the extrinsic 4-rosy orientation ﬁeld
achieves the best results.

Effect of 4-RoSy Surface Convolution. Our third exper-
iment is designed to test how the choice for the surface
convolution operator affects learning. In Table 4, PN+(A)

and PN+ represent PointNet++ with average and max pool-
ing, respectively. GCNN1 and GCNN are geodesic convo-
lutional neural networks [24] with Nρ = 3, Nθ = 1 and
Nρ = Nθ = 3 respectively. ACNN represents anisotropic
convolutional neural networks [3] with Nρ = 3, Nθ = 1.
RoSy1 means a 3x3 convolution along the direction of the
1-rosy orientation ﬁeld. RoSy4 picks an arbitrary direc-
tion from the cross in the 4-rosy ﬁeld. RoSy4(m) applies
3x3 convolution for each direction of the cross in the 4-rosy
ﬁeld, aggregated by max pooling. Ours(A) and Ours repre-
sent our method with average and max pooling aggregation.
We ﬁnd that GCNN, ACNN and RoSy4 produce the low-
est IoUs, because they suffer from inconsistency of frames
when features are aggregated. GCNN1 does not suffer from
this issue since there is only a single bin in the angle di-
mension. RoSy4(m) uses the max-pooling to canonicalize
the feature extraction, which is independent of the orien-
tation selection, and produces better results than RoSy4.
RoSy1 achieves a higher score by generating a more glob-
ally consistent orientation ﬁeld with higher distortion. From
this study, the combination of 4-rosy orientation ﬁeld and
our TextureNet is the best option for the segmentation task
among these methods. Since we precompute the local
parametrization, our training efﬁciency is similar to GCNN.

Effect of High-Resolution Color. Our fourth experiment
tests how much convolving with high-resolution surface
colors affects semantic segmentation. Table 3 compares the
performance of our network with uncolored sampled points
(XYZ), sampled points with the per-point surface normal
and color (NRGB), and with the per-point normal and the

10x10 color texture patch (Highres) as input. According
to Table 4, our network is already superior with only XYZ
or additional NRGB because of the convolution operator.
We ﬁnd that providing TextureNet with Highres colors im-
proves the mean class IoU by 3.3%. As expected, the im-
pact is stronger from some semantic classes than others –
e.g., the IoUs for the bookshelf and picture classes increase
63.1→71.3% and 15.8→21.1%, respectively.

Comparisons Using Only Surface Geometry. As a ﬁnal
experiment, we evaluate the value of the proposed 3D net-
work for semantic segmentation of inputs with only surface
geometry (without color). During experiments on Scan-
Net, TextureNet achieves 50.6% mIoU, which is 6.4% bet-
ter than the previous state-of-the-art. In comparison, Scan-
Net [9] = 30.6%, Tangent Convolution [39] = 40.9%, Point-
Net++ [31] = 43.5%, and SplatNet [37] = 44.2%.

5. Conclusion

TextureNet bridges the gap between 2D image convolu-
tions and 3D deep learning using 4-RoSy surface parameter-
izations. We have demonstarted a new method for learning
from high-resolution signals on 3D meshes by computing
local geodesic neighborhoods with consistent 4-RoSy co-
ordinate systems. We have designed a network of 4-RoSy
texture convolution operators that are able to learn surface
features that signiﬁcantly improve over the state-of-the-art
performance for 3D semantic segmentation of 3D surfaces
with color (by 6.9-8.2%). Code and data will be publicly
available. Topics for further work include investigating
the utility of TextureNet for extracting features from other
high-resolution signals on meshes (e.g., displacement maps,
bump maps, curvature maps, etc.) and applications of Tex-
tureNet to other vision tasks (e.g., instance detection, pose
estimation, part decomposition, texture synthesis, etc.).
