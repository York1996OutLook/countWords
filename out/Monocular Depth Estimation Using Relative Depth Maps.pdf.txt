Abstract

We propose a novel algorithm for monocular depth esti-
mation using relative depth maps. First, using a convolu-
tional neural network, we estimate relative depths between
pairs of regions, as well as ordinary depths, at various
scales. Second, we restore relative depth maps from selec-
tively estimated data based on the rank-1 property of pair-
wise comparison matrices. Third, we decompose ordinary
and relative depth maps into components and recombine
them optimally to reconstruct a ﬁnal depth map. Experi-
mental results show that the proposed algorithm provides
the state-of-art depth estimation performance.

1. Introduction

Depth estimation is a fundamental problem of computer
vision to estimate depth information of a scene from one or
more images. Estimated depths give important geometric
clues in vision applications, such as image synthesis [8, 44],
scene recognition [50, 56], pose estimation [60, 68], and
robotics [4, 34]. There are various techniques for infer-
ring depths from multi-view images [48, 55] or video se-
quences [30, 62], which provide promising results. How-
ever, when only a single image is available, the problem is
challenging since it is ill-posed [12].

Early methods for monocular depth estimation made
assumptions about scenes:
a space composed of box
blocks [16], a scene consisting of planar regions [54], a typ-
ical indoor room with a ﬂoor and walls [9, 32], and the dark
channel prior [17]. However, these methods become unreli-
able when the assumptions are invalid.

In recent years, monocular depth estimation methods
based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [6, 11–
13, 31, 33, 51] have been proposed, with the advance in
computing hardware and the availability of abundant train-
ing data [14, 57], improving the performance dramatically.
Some methods [20, 36, 39, 65, 66] combine CNNs with con-
ditional random ﬁeld (CRF) models to yield more edge-
conforming depth maps. Also, attempts have been made
to estimate depths jointly with closely related data [27, 47,
61, 64, 69], such as surface normal and optical ﬂow.

Figure 1. An overview of the proposed algorithm. First, one ordi-
nary depth map and four relative depth maps are obtained from an
image. Then, they are decomposed into depth components, which
are, in turn, combined to reconstruct an optimal depth map.

These CNN-based methods attempt to estimate absolute
depths directly. However, as noted in [12], monocular depth
estimation is ambiguous in scale: an object may appear the
same as another identically-shaped but smaller object in a
nearer distance. On the other hand, the ratio between depths
of two points, which is referred to as relative depth in this
work, is scale-invariant. It is easier even for a human be-
ing to choose the nearer one between two points than to
estimate the absolute depth of each point. In other words,
relative depths are easier to estimate than ordinary depths.

Based on these observations, we propose a novel monoc-
ular depth estimation algorithm using relative depth maps.
Figure 1 shows an overview of the proposed algorithm.
First, we develop a CNN in the encoder-decoder architec-
ture, which includes multiple decoder blocks for estimating
relative depths, as well as ordinary depths, at various scales.
Second, we form a pairwise comparison matrix, which is
sparsely populated by the estimated relative depths. By ex-
ploiting the rank-1 property of the matrix, we restore the
entire matrix using the alternating least squares (ALS) al-
gorithm [28], from which a relative depth map is obtained.
Third, each depth map is decomposed into components,
which are re-combined to reconstruct a ﬁnal depth map
through a constrained optimization scheme. Experimental
results show that the proposed algorithm provides the state-
of-the-art depth estimation performance.

We highlight main contributions of this work as follows:

• We propose the notion of relative depth and develop an

efﬁcient estimator for relative depth maps based on the
rank-1 property of pairwise comparison matrices.

• We propose novel methods for depth map decomposi-

tion and depth component combination.

• We achieve the state-of-the art depth estimation perfor-

mance on the NYUv2 dataset [57].

2. Related Work

Prior to the extensive adoption of CNNs, hand-crafted
features were used for monocular depth estimation. Sax-
ena et al. [53] proposed a Markov random ﬁeld (MRF)
model to estimate depths from multi-scale patches and
global-scale column patches. Also, Saxena et al. [54] pre-
dicted depths by inferring plane parameters, assuming that
a scene consists of planar regions. Liu et al. [38] exploited
the a priori knowledge of semantic segmentation classes to
predict depths. Karsch et al. [25] assumed that semanti-
cally similar images have similar depth distributions. They
estimated depth maps by searching similar images from a
database and warping them.

Recently, various CNN-based techniques for monocu-
lar depth estimation have been proposed. Eigen et al. [12]
used the AlexNet structure [29] for global depth prediction
and an additional ﬁne scale network for local depth reﬁne-
ment. Eigen and Fergus [11] extended the method in [12]
to three levels and performed depth estimation, normal esti-
mation, and semantic segmentation jointly. Roy and Todor-
ovic [51] proposed a depth estimation model to incorporate
shallow CNNs into a regression forest. Laina et al. [31]
developed a depth estimation network based on the ResNet
structure [19] and also proposed an up-projection module
to increase depth map resolutions. Fu et al. [13] proposed
the deep ordinal regression network (DORN), which trans-
forms the depth regression task into a classiﬁcation prob-
lem. Their algorithm yielded the state-of-the-art depth esti-
mation performance.

To generate sharper and more edge-conforming depth
maps, conditional random ﬁeld (CRF) models are often
combined with CNNs. Li et al. [36] estimated depth in-
formation at the superpixel level using a CNN and reﬁned it
at the pixel level based on a CRF model. Liu et al. [40] de-
veloped another superpixel-based algorithm. They trained
unary and pairwise terms of CRF within a CNN framework.
Xu et al. [65] extracted feature maps at several CNN layers,
performed CRF optimization at those layers to yield multi-
ple depth maps, and integrated them into a ﬁnal depth map.
Heo et al. [20] predicted depths and also the corresponding
reliability levels. They exploited the reliability information
in the CRF optimization. Xu et al. [66] integrated multi-
scale CRF optimization into an encoder-decoder network,
enabling end-to-end training.

Extending the domain of training data tends to have pos-

itive impacts on the estimation performance of a deep net-
work. Therefore, some methods utilize additional annota-
tion data to train depth estimation networks. For instance,
Wang et al. [61] proposed a joint CNN structure for depth
map estimation and semantic segmentation. Moreover, they
improved depth estimation results via CRF optimization.
Qi et al. [47] utilized the geometric relationship between
surface normals and depths, improving the results of both
normal and depth estimation. Also, Yin and Shi [69] pro-
posed a joint estimation algorithm for depths, optical ﬂow,
and camera motion.

The methods in [7, 70] are similar to the proposed algo-
rithm in that they also use pairwise depth comparison results
between pixels for monocular depth estimation. Zoran et
al. [70] predicted relative depths between sampled points
and propagated them to superpixels to reconstruct an en-
tire depth map. Chen et al. [7] categorized relative depths
between pixels into three classes: “closer,” “further,” and
“equal.” They obtained pixel-level predictions by training
their network with different loss functions according to pair-
wise labels. The proposed algorithm, however, is different
from [7, 70]. While [7, 70] use comparison results between
coarsely sampled points, the proposed algorithm estimates
dense pairwise information and combines it with ordinary
depth maps to reconstruct ﬁne scale depth information.

3. Proposed Algorithm

3.1. Depth Map Decomposition

Let I ∈ Rr×c be an image of size r ×c. The goal is to es-
timate the corresponding depth map D ∈ Rr×c. However,
this monocular depth estimation is ill-posed. Especially, it
is ambiguous in scale [12]. For instance, a building and its
small replica may produce an identical image, but have dif-
ferent depth maps. Even though we can predict the scale
of an image approximately by learning from many training
images, the ambiguity still remains. To address this issue, in
this work, we deﬁne and estimate a scale-invariant quantity,
called relative depth, which is the ratio between the depths
of two regions in an image.

If we know the relative depths of all pixel pairs in an
image, we can reconstruct the depth map with a normalized
scale. Before proving this, let us denote the geometric mean
of a depth map D by

g(D) =

r

c

Y

Y

i=1

j=1

D(i, j)

1
rc

(1)

where D(i, j) is the (i, j)th depth in D.

Proposition 1. If the relative depths of all pixel pairs in I
is known, then a scaled depth map D/g(D) can be recon-
structed.

9730

Proof. By assumption, for any pixel (i, j), we know all rel-
ative depths in D/D(i, j). By averaging these depths ge-
ometrically, we obtain g(D)/D(i, j). Therefore, we know
its reciprocal D(i, j)/g(D). Then, we have D/g(D).

In fact, D/g(D) has the normalized scale as follows.

Proposition 2. The geometric mean of D/g(D) is 1.

Proof. g(D/g(D)) = g(D)/g(D) = 1.

According to Propositions 1 and 2, if we know all rela-
tive depths between pixel pairs, we can reconstruct the rel-
ative depth map

R = D/g(D),

(2)

which is referred to as the relative depth map. Then, the
relationship between the original depth map D and the rel-
ative depth map R can be rewritten as D = g(D)R.

Next, we reduce the depth map D to several sizes. Let
Dn denote the depth map of size 2n × 2n. A lower resolu-
tion depth map Dn−1 is obtained from Dn via

Dn−1(i, j) =

1

1

Y

Y

k=0

l=0

Dn(2i − k, 2j − l)

4 .

(3)

In other words, a depth in Dn−1 is the geometric mean of
the four corresponding depths in Dn. Note that the lowest
resolution map D0 consists of a single depth, which equals
the overall geometric mean g(D).

In a typical depth map, low frequency components are
more dominant [33]. Thus, their estimation affects depth re-
construction more strongly than the estimation of high fre-
quency components. We regard Dn−1 as low frequency in-
formation, which is obtained by eliminating high frequency
(or ﬁne detail) information in Dn. Let Fn denote the ﬁne
detail map. First, we deﬁne the upsampling operation U to
double the size of a depth map horizontally and vertically. It
repeats each input depth four times to ﬁll in the correspond-
ing four pixels in the output depth map. Then, Fn is given
by

Fn = Dn ⊘ U (Dn−1)

(4)

where ⊘ denotes the Hadamard division, i.e. element-wise
division, of two matrices. Equivalently,

Dn = U (Dn−1) ⊗ Fn

(5)

where ⊗ is the Hadamard product.

In a logarithmic scale, Dn can be decomposed through

the recursive application of (5),

log Dn = log U n(D0) +

n

X

i=1

log U n−i(Fi)

(6)

where log is an element-wise logarithmic function. In other
words, log Dn is decomposed into the mean depth map
log U n(D0) and the residual depth maps log U n−i(Fi) for
1 ≤ i ≤ n. Note that, by Proposition 3, the arithmetic
mean of each residual map log U n−i(Fi) is zero. Similarly,
the relative depth map Rn can be decomposed as

log Rn =

n

X

i=1

log U n−i(Fi).

In this work, given an image I, we estimate Dn and Rn
for 3 ≤ n ≤ 7. Then, we decompose each Dn or Rn via (6)
or (7), respectively. Table 1 lists the decomposition results
of these depth maps. Note that each component has multi-
ple candidates. For example, F1 has 10 candidates in total,
while F6 has 4. We combine the candidates to yield the
optimal depth component, as described in Section 3.4 and
in a supplemental document. Finally, we use the optimal
components to generate the optimal depth map D7 via (6).

3.2. Depth Estimation Network

We use the encoder-decoder architecture [2, 67] to esti-
mate depth maps, as shown in Figure 2. In the encoder part,
deep features are extracted from an image. In the decoder
part, up to ten decoders use these features to reconstruct or-
dinary depth maps Dn and relative depth maps Rn.
Encoder part: The encoder processes an image to yield
low-resolution, high-level features. DenseNet-BC [23], ex-
cluding the last dense block, is used as the encoder, which
consists of one convolution layer, one max pooling layer,
and three pairs of dense block and transition layer, as shown
in Figure 2. Note that the last dense block in DenseNet-BC
is employed in the ten decoders in the decoder part.

Each dense block in DenseNet-BC is deﬁned by hyper-
parameters: the number n of composite functions and the
growth rate k. The settings of the dense blocks, includ-
ing the hyper-parameters, are described in the supplemental

Figure 2. The structure of the proposed depth estimation network. As shown above, up to ten decoders can be used. In the default setting,

layer, and ALS an alternating least squares layer.

document. Overall, given an 224 × 224 RGB image, the en-
coder generates an 8 × 8 feature map with 1,056 channels.

Decoder part: The ten decoders are used to expand the
low-resolution features to higher-resolution depth maps Dn
and Rn. Each decoder has one dense block and a variable
number (0 to 4) of whole strip masking (WSM) blocks [20].
WSM is an up-sampling block in the inception structure
[58, 59]. It increases the receptive ﬁeld greatly, by applying
kernels whose horizontal or vertical sizes equal those of an
entire input signal. It has ﬁve inception paths, which use
convolution kernels of sizes 1 × 1, 3 × 3, 5 × 5, W × 3, and
3 × H, respectively. Here, W and H denote the width and
height of an input signal.

The resolution of a target depth map determines the num-
ber of WSM blocks. For example, the decoders for estimat-
ing D3 and R3 include no WSM block, since D3 and R3
have 8 × 8 resolution that is equal to the resolution of the
encoder feature map. On the other hand, the decoders for
D7 and R7 use 4 WSM blocks, respectively, to extend the
feature map to 128 × 128 resolution.

Ordinal regression: Each decoder performs ordinal regres-
sion [37] to reconstruct depths. An ordinal regression task
can be carried out using multiple binary classiﬁers, which
determine if a value is greater than different thresholds, re-
spectively. Various ordinal regression methods have been
proposed to solve regression problems [13, 24, 46]. In par-
ticular, Fu et al. [13] proposed a regression network, called
DORN, for monocular depth estimation. For ordinal regres-
sion, they quantized a depth into a number of reconstruction
levels using the space-increasing discretization scheme. We
adopt their reconstruction levels and ordinal loss function in

the decoders for ordinary depth maps Dn.

However, in the decoders for relative depth maps Rn, it
is necessary to use a different set of reconstruction levels.
Note that a relative depth is a ratio of two depths. Thus,
for any relative depth r, there is always a reciprocal one
1/r.
In other words, in a logarithmic scale, the distribu-
tion of relative depths is symmetric with respect to zero.
To determine reconstruction levels for R3, we compute the
depth ratios for all pixel pairs from training data. We ap-
ply the Lloyd algorithm [42] to quantize them. To exploit
the symmetry, we perform the algorithm only for the ratios
greater than or equal to 1. Then, we ﬁx 1 as one reconstruc-
tion level to conform to the symmetry, and determine 20
more reconstruction levels by alternating the nearest neigh-
bor partitioning and the centroid computation [15]. Their
reciprocals also become reconstruction levels. In total, there
are 41 reconstruction levels. Also, reconstruction levels for
Rn for 4 ≤ n ≤ 7 are set to half the level interval of Rn−1.
Relative depths can be estimated for all pairs of pixels.
This, however, demands excessive complexity, since (2n ×
2n)×(2n ×2n) = 24n pairs should be considered in Dn. To
reduce the complexity, for each pixel in Dn, we estimate the
depth ratios with respect to the neighboring 3×3 pixels only,
reducing the number of pairs to 32×22n. Furthermore, these
neighboring 3 × 3 pixels are selected from Dn−1, instead
of Dn, as shown in Figure 3. This is advantageous, since
each depth in Dn is compared with a larger region for a
ﬁxed number of comparisons. Unestimated relative depths
are reconstructed using the ALS algorithm, as detailed in
Section 3.3.

Figure 3. To estimate relative depths, each depth in Dn, depicted
by a dot, is compared with the depths of the 3 × 3 nearest pixels in
Dn−1, which are depicted by purple squares. For the illustration,
Dn is overlaid with Dn−1.

3.3. Relative Depth Map Reconstruction

In Figure 2, the bottom decoders 6 ∼ 10 estimate relative
depth maps Rn, 3 ≤ n ≤ 7, respectively. To reduce the
complexity, they estimate relative depths selectively. The
remaining relative depths are reconstructed as follows.

First, in decoder 6, the relative depths for all pixel pairs
in the lowest-resolution depth map D3 are estimated. In-
evitably, there are estimation errors. Let us consider three
pixels i, j, and k. The decoder estimates relative depths
D3(j) , D3(j)
D3(i)
D3(k) . However, due to estimation er-
rors, the results may be inconsistent, i.e. it is possible that
D3(j) × D3(j)
D3(i)
D3(k) . We should process the estimated
relative depth to yield consistent and reliable results.

D3(k) , and D3(i)

D3(k) 6= D3(i)

To this end, we construct the pairwise comparison ma-
trix P3, which contains the relative depths between all pixel
pairs in D3. Since the number of pixels in D3 is 8 × 8, the
size of P3 is 64 × 64. The (i, j)th element P3 is given by
the estimate of dj/di, where di denotes the ith depth in the
reshaped vector of D3.

Proposition 4. If there is no estimation error, P3 is a rank-
1 matrix.

Proof. In the ideal case with no error, we have P3 =
[d1, d2, · · · , d64]T [ 1
d1

, · · · , 1
d64

, 1

].

If there are errors, Saaty [52] showed that the principal
eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of P3
is a good approximation of [d1, d2, · · · , d64]T up to a scale
factor. Note that, by the Perron-Frobenius theorem [21],
since P3 is positive, the largest eigenvector is algebraically
simple and positive and all elements in the principal eigen-
vector are also positive. Thus, by normalizing the principal
eigenvector so that the geometric mean of elements is 1, we
reconstruct the relative depth map R3.

To reconstruct Rn for 4 ≤ n ≤ 7, we should redeﬁne the
comparison matrix, since depths in Dn are compared with
those in Dn−1 as shown in Figure 3. Similar to P3 in the

where dn
i denotes the ith depth in the reshaped vector of
Dn. Without estimation errors, the rank of Pn,n−1 is also 1.
When there are estimation errors, the eigenvalue decompo-
sition method for reconstructing R3 cannot be used in this
case because Pn,n−1 is not a square matrix. Instead, we
may use singular value decomposition (SVD). It is known
that

ˆPn,n−1 = σ1u1vT

(9)
is the best rank-1 approximation of Pn,n−1 [5], where σ1
is the largest singular value, and u1 and v1 are the corre-
sponding singular vectors. Therefore, Rn can be obtained
by normalizing the left singular vector u1.

However, as shown in Figure 3, only a portion of rela-
tive depths, dn
, are estimated and Pn,n−1 is incom-
plete. The missing entries of Pn,n−1 should be ﬁlled in
appropriately before the rank-1 approximation. Various al-
gorithms [26, 49] have been proposed to solve this matrix
completion problem. We employ the ALS algorithm [28]
as follows. Let S denote the set of positions (r, c) in
Pn,n−1, where the relative depths are estimated by the de-
coder. Also, let p and q be vectors of size 22n and 22n−2,
respectively. Then, we repeat the following two steps alter-
nately.

p ← arg min

(10)

(11)

In each step, the convex condition is satisﬁed and the closed
form solution for q or p is easily derived. Thus, the algo-
rithm yields convergent solutions ˜p and ˜q, and the approxi-
mation

˜Pn,n−1 = ˜p˜qT

(12)

9733

is obtained. Notice that this is already a rank-1 approxi-
mation of Pn,n−1. Therefore, we reconstruct the relative
depth map Rn by normalizing and reshaping the left vector
˜p. Figure 4 shows this process of ﬁlling a sparse Pn,n−1
and restoring a relative depth map Rn.

3.4. Depth Component Combination

In general, an ordinary depth map reconstructs the over-
all depth distribution robustly, while relative depth maps
are better for estimating ﬁne details. Also, depending on
the resolution, each relative depth map estimates depth in-
formation at a certain scale reliably. Thus, by combining
all these maps at multiple resolutions, we obtain a faithful
depth map that takes advantages of those component maps.
We estimate up to ten depth maps, Dn and Rn for 3 ≤
n ≤ 7, each of which is decomposed into components, as
listed in Table 1. Since there are multiple candidates for
each component, we obtain an optimal estimate by linearly
combining them in a logarithmic domain. For the optimal
combination, we minimize the mean squared error, subject
to constraints on weighting parameters (e.g. nonnegativity
of weights), using the interior point method [1]. Then, we
use these optimal components to generate a ﬁnal depth map
via (6). The optimal combination method is described in
more detail in the supplemental document.

4. Experimental Results

4.1. Dataset and Evaluation Protocol

We assess the performance of the proposed algorithm
on the NYUv2 dataset [57].
It includes indoor video se-
quences, composed of RGB images of spatial resolution
480 × 640 and the corresponding depth maps captured with
Microsoft Kinect devices. A captured depth map has miss-
ing regions, and the method in [35] is used to ﬁll in those
regions. We use all training sequences to train the pro-
posed algorithm and employ the 654 test RGBD images for
evaluation. Also, we valid-crop the test images to spatial
resolution 427 × 561, as done in [6, 33, 41]. For quanti-
tative assessment of depth maps, we use seven metrics in
Table 2 [10, 12, 31]. Among them, the Spearman’s ρ is
the correlation coefﬁcient between the ranks of estimated
depths and ground-truth depths [10]. It measures how well
an estimated depth map preserves the ordering (or ranks) of
pixel depths in the ground-truth depth map.

KITTI [14] is another dataset widely used for evaluating
monocular depth estimation algorithms. We show that the
proposed algorithm provides competitive performances also
on KITTI in the supplemental document.

We initialize the network parameters as done in [18] and
optimize them using the Nestrov method [45]. We set the

initial learning rate, momentum, and weight decay to 10−5,
0.9, and 10−4, respectively. Also, we adjust the learning
rate based on the repetitive shifted cosine function [22, 43].
We set the cycle of the cosine function to 1/4 epoch.

We train the network in two steps. First, we train the en-
coder with a single decoder, which is the decoder for gen-
erating D3 in Figure 2. Second, after ﬁxing the encoder
parameters, we train each of the ten decoders. We set the
batch size to 4, except for the decoder for R7, for which the
batch size is 2 due to the limited GPU memory.

4.3. Comparison with the State of the Arts

Table 3 compares the proposed algorithm with conven-
tional algorithms [3, 6, 7, 11–13, 31, 33, 36, 39, 41, 63, 66, 70]
on the NYUv2 dataset. Some algorithms use different meth-
ods for depth map cropping and performance measurement.
Therefore, for a fair comparison, we adopted the evaluation
scheme of [6, 33, 41] as the common method and attempted
to follow it as closely as possible. Speciﬁcally, for the algo-
rithms in [6, 11–13, 31, 33, 39], the result depth maps, pro-
vided by the respective authors or generated by the source
codes by the authors, are evaluated by the common method.
For the other algorithms, the performance scores are ex-
cerpted directly from the papers.

It can be observed from Table 3 that, in terms of 6 (out of
8) metrics, the proposed algorithm outperforms all the con-
ventional algorithms using only the NYUv2 RGBD train-
ing data. In the other two metrics, ARD and (δ < 1.25),
the proposed algorithm yields the third best and the second
best performances, respectively. Especially, the proposed
algorithm provides a signiﬁcantly higher ρ than the conven-
tional algorithms. This means that the proposed algorithm
predicts the depth orders of pixels more accurately by es-
timating relative depth maps, containing order information,
as well as ordinary depth maps.

Figure 5 shows qualitative comparison results. As com-
pared with the conventional algorithms [13, 31], the pro-
posed algorithm provides more accurate depth maps with
less errors. Even though Fu et al. [13] yield smaller er-
rors than Laina et al. [31], their errors have disorderly pat-
terns and thus their depth maps look noisier. In contrast,

the proposed algorithm provides cleaner depth maps and
outperforms the conventional algorithms both quantitatively
and qualitatively. Also, ﬁgure 6 compares the 3D visual-
ization results of depth maps. Again, the proposed algo-
rithm shows more reliable results than the conventional al-
gorithms [13, 31].

4.4. Ablation Study

The proposed algorithm uses up to ten decoders in Fig-
ure 2 to generate ordinary depth maps Dn and relative depth
maps Rn. Table 4 summarizes the depth estimation results
according to different combinations of ordinary and relative
maps. The following observations can be made:

• When only a single ordinary depth map is used, a

higher resolution one provides better results.

• Relative depths maps should be combined with at least
one ordinary map to reconstruct depths, since they do
not contain scale information (i.e. the mean depth).
However, relative maps are more effective than ordi-
nary ones. For example, when all relative maps are
combined with the lowest resolution D3, the RMSE
(lin) score is 0.538, which is better than that (= 0.550)
of combining all ordinary maps.

• Combining D3 with four relative maps R3, R4, R5,
R6 provides comparable or even better performances

than using all ten depth maps. For example, the former
yields ρ = 0.914, while the latter ρ = 0.912. This in-
dicates that the additional ordinary maps rather distort
the ground-truth depth ordering of a scene. Thus, we
use only the ﬁve depth maps (D3, R3, R4, R5, R6) in
the default mode.

• Adding R7 to the default mode improves the perfor-

mances only slightly.

More ablation studies and more experimental results are

available in the supplemental document.

5. Conclusions

We proposed a novel approach to monocular depth es-
timation, which uses relative depth maps. First, we de-
veloped the encoder-decoder network that has multiple de-
coder blocks for estimating relative depths, as well as or-
dinary ones, at various scales. To reduce complexity, we
restored an entire relative depth map from selectively es-
timated data using the ALS algorithm. Finally, we recon-
structed an optimal depth map through the depth map de-
composition and the depth component combination. Ex-
periments demonstrated that the proposed algorithm pro-
vides the state-of-the-art performance, and an ablation study
showed that relative depth maps are more effective than or-
dinary ones in preserving the depth ordering of a scene.
