Abstract

Data augmentation is an effective technique for improv-
ing the accuracy of modern image classiﬁers. However, cur-
rent data augmentation implementations are manually de-
signed. In this paper, we describe a simple procedure called
AutoAugment to automatically search for improved data
augmentation policies. In our implementation, we have de-
signed a search space where a policy consists of many sub-
policies, one of which is randomly chosen for each image
in each mini-batch. A sub-policy consists of two opera-
tions, each operation being an image processing function
such as translation, rotation, or shearing, and the probabil-
ities and magnitudes with which the functions are applied.
We use a search algorithm to ﬁnd the best policy such that
the neural network yields the highest validation accuracy
on a target dataset. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet
(without additional data). On ImageNet, we attain a Top-1
accuracy of 83.5% which is 0.4% better than the previous
record of 83.1%. On CIFAR-10, we achieve an error rate of
1.5%, which is 0.6% better than the previous state-of-the-
art. Augmentation policies we ﬁnd are transferable between
datasets. The policy learned on ImageNet transfers well to
achieve signiﬁcant improvements on other datasets, such as
Oxford Flowers, Caltech-101, Oxford-IIT Pets, FGVC Air-
craft, and Stanford Cars.

1. Introduction

Deep neural nets are powerful machine learning systems
that tend to work well when trained on massive amounts
of data. Data augmentation is an effective technique to in-
crease both the amount and diversity of data by randomly
“augmenting” it [3, 54, 29]; in the image domain, common
augmentations include translating the image by a few pix-
els, or ﬂipping the image horizontally. Intuitively, data aug-
mentation is used to teach a model about invariances in the

data domain: classifying an object is often insensitive to
horizontal ﬂips or translation. Network architectures can
also be used to hardcode invariances: convolutional net-
works bake in translation invariance [16, 32, 25, 29]. How-
ever, using data augmentation to incorporate potential in-
variances can be easier than hardcoding invariances into the
model architecture directly.

Table 1. Error rates (%) from this paper compared to the best re-
sults so far on ﬁve datasets (Top-5 for ImageNet, Top-1 for the
others). Previous best result on Stanford Cars ﬁne-tuned weights
originally trained on a larger dataset [66], whereas we use a ran-
domly initialized network. Previous best results on other datasets
only include models that were not trained on additional data, for
a single evaluation (without ensembling). See Tables 2,3, and 4
for more detailed comparison. GPU hours are estimated for an
NVIDIA Tesla P100.

Yet a large focus of the machine learning and computer
vision community has been to engineer better network ar-
chitectures (e.g., [55, 59, 20, 58, 64, 19, 72, 23, 48]). Less
attention has been paid to ﬁnding better data augmentation
methods that incorporate more invariances. For instance,
on ImageNet, the data augmentation approach by [29], in-
troduced in 2012, remains the standard with small changes.
Even when augmentation improvements have been found
for a particular dataset, they often do not transfer to other
datasets as effectively. For example, horizontal ﬂipping of
images during training is an effective data augmentation
method on CIFAR-10, but not on MNIST, due to the dif-
ferent symmetries present in these datasets. The need for
automatically learned data-augmentation has been raised re-
cently as an important unsolved problem [57].

In this paper, we aim to automate the process of ﬁnding
an effective data augmentation policy for a target dataset.
In our implementation (Section 3), each policy expresses

1113

several choices and orders of possible augmentation opera-
tions, where each operation is an image processing func-
tion (e.g.,
translation, rotation, or color normalization),
the probabilities of applying the function, and the magni-
tudes with which they are applied. We use a search al-
gorithm to ﬁnd the best choices and orders of these oper-
ations such that training a neural network yields the best
validation accuracy. In our experiments, we use Reinforce-
ment Learning [71] as the search algorithm, but we believe
the results can be further improved if better algorithms are
used [48, 39].

Our extensive experiments show that AutoAugment
achieves excellent improvements in two use cases: 1) Au-
toAugment can be applied directly on the dataset of interest
to ﬁnd the best augmentation policy (AutoAugment-direct)
and 2) learned policies can be transferred to new datasets
(AutoAugment-transfer). Firstly, for direct application, our
method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on datasets such
as CIFAR-10, reduced CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, re-
duced SVHN, and ImageNet (without additional data). On
CIFAR-10, we achieve an error rate of 1.5%, which is 0.6%
better than the previous state-of-the-art [48]. On SVHN,
we improve the state-of-the-art error rate from 1.3% [12]
to 1.0%. On reduced datasets, our method achieves per-
formance comparable to semi-supervised methods without
using any unlabeled data. On ImageNet, we achieve a Top-
1 accuracy of 83.5% which is 0.4% better than the previous
record of 83.1%. Secondly, if direct application is too ex-
pensive, transferring an augmentation policy can be a good
alternative. For transferring an augmentation policy, we
show that policies found on one task can generalize well
across different models and datasets. For example, the pol-
icy found on ImageNet leads to signiﬁcant improvements
on a variety of FGVC datasets. Even on datasets for which
ﬁne-tuning weights pre-trained on ImageNet does not help
signiﬁcantly [26], e.g. Stanford Cars [27] and FGVC Air-
craft [38], training with the ImageNet policy reduces test
set error by 1.2% and 1.8%, respectively. This result sug-
gests that transferring data augmentation policies offers an
alternative method for standard weight transfer learning. A
summary of our results is shown in Table 1.

2. Related Work

Common data augmentation methods for image recog-
nition have been designed manually and the best augmenta-
tion strategies are dataset-speciﬁc. For example, on MNIST,
most top-ranked models use elastic distortions, scale, trans-
lation, and rotation [54, 8, 62, 52]. On natural image
datasets, such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, random crop-
ping, image mirroring and color shifting / whitening are
more common [29]. As these methods are designed manu-
ally, they require expert knowledge and time. Our approach
of learning data augmentation policies from data in princi-

ple can be used for any dataset, not just one.

This paper introduces an automated approach to ﬁnd data
augmentation policies from data. Our approach is inspired
by recent advances in architecture search, where reinforce-
ment learning and evolution have been used to discover
model architectures from data [71, 4, 72, 7, 35, 13, 34, 46,
49, 63, 48, 9]. Although these methods have improved upon
human-designed architectures, it has not been possible to
beat the 2% error-rate barrier on CIFAR-10 using architec-
ture search alone.

Previous attempts at learned data augmentations include
Smart Augmentation, which proposed a network that au-
tomatically generates augmented data by merging two or
more samples from the same class [33]. Tran et al. used a
Bayesian approach to generate data based on the distribu-
tion learned from the training set [61]. DeVries and Taylor
used simple transformations in the learned feature space to
augment data [11].

Generative adversarial networks have also been used for
the purpose of generating additional data (e.g., [45, 41, 70,
2, 56]). The key difference between our method and gen-
erative models is that our method generates symbolic trans-
formation operations, whereas generative models, such as
GANs, generate the augmented data directly. An exception
is work by Ratner et al., who used GANs to generate se-
quences that describe data augmentation strategies [47].

3. AutoAugment: Searching for best Augmen-
tation policies Directly on the Dataset of In-
terest

We formulate the problem of ﬁnding the best augmen-
tation policy as a discrete search problem (see Figure 1).
Our method consists of two components: A search algo-
rithm and a search space. At a high level, the search al-
gorithm (implemented as a controller RNN) samples a data
augmentation policy S, which has information about what
image processing operation to use, the probability of using
the operation in each batch, and the magnitude of the oper-
ation. Key to our method is the fact that the policy S will
be used to train a neural network with a ﬁxed architecture,
whose validation accuracy R will be sent back to update the
controller. Since R is not differentiable, the controller will
be updated by policy gradient methods.
In the following
section we will describe the two components in detail.

Search space details: In our search space, a policy con-
sists of 5 sub-policies with each sub-policy consisting of
two image operations to be applied in sequence. Addition-
ally, each operation is also associated with two hyperpa-
rameters: 1) the probability of applying the operation, and
2) the magnitude of the operation.

Figure 2 shows an example of a policy with 5-sub-
policies in our search space. The ﬁrst sub-policy speciﬁes

114

ered all functions in PIL that accept an image as input and
output an image. We additionally used two other promis-
ing augmentation techniques: Cutout [12] and SamplePair-
ing [24]. The operations we searched over are ShearX/Y,
TranslateX/Y, Rotate, AutoContrast, Invert, Equalize, So-
larize, Posterize, Contrast, Color, Brightness, Sharpness,
Cutout [12], Sample Pairing [24].2
In total, we have 16
operations in our search space. Each operation also comes
with a default range of magnitudes, which will be described
in more detail in Section 4. We discretize the range of mag-
nitudes into 10 values (uniform spacing) so that we can use
a discrete search algorithm to ﬁnd them. Similarly, we also
discretize the probability of applying that operation into 11
values (uniform spacing). Finding each sub-policy becomes
a search problem in a space of (16 × 10 × 11)2 possibilities.
Our goal, however, is to ﬁnd 5 such sub-policies concur-
rently in order to increase diversity. The search space with 5
sub-policies then has roughly (16×10×11)10 ≈ 2.9×1032
possibilities.

The 16 operations we used and their default range of val-
ues are shown in Table 1 in the Appendix. Notice that there
is no explicit “Identity” operation in our search space; this
operation is implicit, and can be achieved by calling an op-
eration with probability set to be 0.

Search algorithm details: The search algorithm that
we used in our experiment uses Reinforcement Learning,
inspired by [71, 4, 72, 5]. The search algorithm has two
components: a controller, which is a recurrent neural net-
work, and the training algorithm, which is the Proximal
Policy Optimization algorithm [53]. At each step, the con-
troller predicts a decision produced by a softmax; the pre-
diction is then fed into the next step as an embedding. In
total the controller has 30 softmax predictions in order to
predict 5 sub-policies, each with 2 operations, and each op-
eration requiring an operation type, magnitude and proba-
bility.

The training of controller RNN: The controller is
trained with a reward signal, which is how good the policy is
in improving the generalization of a “child model” (a neural
network trained as part of the search process). In our exper-
iments, we set aside a validation set to measure the gen-
eralization of a child model. A child model is trained with
augmented data generated by applying the 5 sub-policies on
the training set (that does not contain the validation set). For
each example in the mini-batch, one of the 5 sub-policies is
chosen randomly to augment the image. The child model
is then evaluated on the validation set to measure the accu-
racy, which is used as the reward signal to train the recurrent
network controller. On each dataset, the controller samples
about 15,000 policies.

Figure 1. Overview of our framework of using a search method
(e.g., Reinforcement Learning) to search for better data augmen-
tation policies. A controller RNN predicts an augmentation policy
from the search space. A child network with a ﬁxed architecture
is trained to convergence achieving accuracy R. The reward R will
be used with the policy gradient method to update the controller
so that it can generate better policies over time.

a sequential application of ShearX followed by Invert. The
probability of applying ShearX is 0.9, and when applied,
has a magnitude of 7 out of 10. We then apply Invert with
probability of 0.8. The Invert operation does not use the
magnitude information. We emphasize that these operations
are applied in the speciﬁed order.

Figure 2. One of the policies found on SVHN, and how it can be
used to generate augmented data given an original image used to
train a neural network. The policy has 5 sub-policies. For every
image in a mini-batch, we choose a sub-policy uniformly at ran-
dom to generate a transformed image to train the neural network.
Each sub-policy consists of 2 operations, each operation is associ-
ated with two numerical values: the probability of calling the op-
eration, and the magnitude of the operation. There is a probability
of calling an operation, so the operation may not be applied in that
mini-batch. However, if applied, it is applied with the ﬁxed mag-
nitude. We highlight the stochasticity in applying the sub-policies
by showing how one image can be transformed differently in dif-
ferent mini-batches, even with the same sub-policy. As explained
in the text, on SVHN, geometric transformations are picked more
often by AutoAugment. It can be seen why Invert is a commonly
selected operation on SVHN, since the numbers in the image are
invariant to that transformation.

The operations we used in our experiments are from PIL,
a popular Python image library.1 For generality, we consid-

parameters: We follow the training procedure and hyper-

parameters from [72] for training the controller. More con-
cretely, the controller RNN is a one-layer LSTM [21] with
100 hidden units at each layer and 2 × 5B softmax predic-
tions for the two convolutional cells (where B is typically
5) associated with each architecture decision. Each of the
10B predictions of the controller RNN is associated with
a probability. The joint probability of a child network is
the product of all probabilities at these 10B softmaxes. This
joint probability is used to compute the gradient for the con-
troller RNN. The gradient is scaled by the validation accu-
racy of the child network to update the controller RNN such
that the controller assigns low probabilities for bad child
networks and high probabilities for good child networks.
Similar to [72], we employ Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO) [53] with learning rate 0.00035. To encourage ex-
ploration we also use an entropy penalty with a weight of
0.00001.
In our implementation, the baseline function is
an exponential moving average of previous rewards with a
weight of 0.95. The weights of the controller are initial-
ized uniformly between -0.1 and 0.1. We choose to train
the controller using PPO out of convenience, although prior
work had shown that other methods (e.g. augmented ran-
dom search and evolutionary strategies) can perform as well
or even slightly better [30].

At the end of the search, we concatenate the sub-policies
from the best 5 policies into a single policy (with 25 sub-
policies). This ﬁnal policy with 25 sub-policies is used to
train the models for each dataset.

The above search algorithm is one of many possible
search algorithms we can use to ﬁnd the best policies. It
might be possible to use a different discrete search algo-
rithm such as genetic programming [48] or even random
search [6] to improve the results in this paper.

4. Experiments and Results

Summary of Experiments.
In this section, we empir-
ically investigate the performance of AutoAugment
in
two use cases: AutoAugment-direct and AutoAugment-
transfer. First, we will benchmark AutoAugment with
direct search for best augmentation policies on highly
competitive datasets: CIFAR-10 [28], CIFAR-100 [28],
SVHN [42] (Section 4.1), and ImageNet [10] (Section 4.2)
datasets. Our results show that a direct application of Au-
toAugment improves signiﬁcantly the baseline models and
produces state-of-the-art accuracies on these challenging
datasets. Next, we will study the transferability of aug-
mentation policies between datasets. More concretely, we
will transfer the best augmentation policies found on Ima-
geNet to ﬁne-grained classiﬁcation datasets such as Oxford
102 Flowers, Caltech-101, Oxford-IIIT Pets, FGVC Air-
craft, Stanford Cars (Section 4.3). Our results also show
that augmentation policies are surprisingly transferable and
yield signiﬁcant improvements on strong baseline models

on these datasets. Finally, in Section 5, we will compare
AutoAugment against other automated data augmentation
methods and show that AutoAugment is signiﬁcantly bet-
ter.

4.1. CIFAR 10, CIFAR 100, SVHN Results

Although CIFAR-10 has 50,000 training examples, we
perform the search for the best policies on a smaller dataset
we call “reduced CIFAR-10”, which consists of 4,000 ran-
domly chosen examples, to save time for training child
models during the augmentation search process (We ﬁnd
that the resulting policies do not seem to be sensitive to this
number). We ﬁnd that for a ﬁxed amount of training time,
it is more useful to allow child models to train for more
epochs rather than train for fewer epochs with more training
data. For the child model architecture we use small Wide-
ResNet-40-2 (40 layers - widening factor of 2) model [67],
and train for 120 epochs. The use of a small Wide-ResNet is
for computational efﬁciency as each child model is trained
from scratch to compute the gradient update for the con-
troller. We use a weight decay of 10−4, learning rate of
0.01, and a cosine learning decay with one annealing cy-
cle [36].

The policies found during the search on reduced CIFAR-
10 are later used to train ﬁnal models on CIFAR-10, reduced
CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. As mentioned above, we con-
catenate sub-policies from the best 5 policies to form a sin-
gle policy with 25 sub-policies, which is used for all of Au-
toAugment experiments on the CIFAR datasets.

The baseline pre-processing follows the convention for
state-of-the-art CIFAR-10 models: standardizing the data,
using horizontal ﬂips with 50% probability, zero-padding
and random crops, and ﬁnally Cutout with 16x16 pix-
els [17, 65, 48, 72]. The AutoAugment policy is applied
in addition to the standard baseline pre-processing: on one
image, we ﬁrst apply the baseline augmentation provided by
the existing baseline methods, then apply the AutoAugment
policy, then apply Cutout. We did not optimize the Cutout
region size, and use the suggested value of 16 pixels [12].
Note that since Cutout is an operation in the search space,
Cutout may be used twice on the same image: the ﬁrst time
with learned region size, and the second time with ﬁxed re-
gion size. In practice, as the probability of the Cutout op-
eration in the ﬁrst application is small, Cutout is often used
once on a given image.

On CIFAR-10, AutoAugment picks mostly color-based
transformations. For example, the most commonly picked
transformations on CIFAR-10 are Equalize, AutoContrast,
Color, and Brightness (refer to Table 1 in the Appendix for
their descriptions). Geometric transformations like ShearX
and ShearY are rarely found in good policies. Furthermore,
the transformation Invert is almost never applied in a suc-
cessful policy. The policy found on CIFAR-10 is included

116

in the Appendix. Below, we describe our results on the CI-
FAR datasets using the policy found on reduced CIFAR-10.
All of the reported results are averaged over 5 runs.

CIFAR-10 Results.
In Table 2, we show the test set ac-
curacy on different neural network architectures. We im-
plement the Wide-ResNet-28-10 [67], Shake-Shake [17]
and ShakeDrop [65] models in TensorFlow[1], and ﬁnd
the weight decay and learning rate hyperparameters that
give the best validation set accuracy for regular training
with baseline augmentation. Other hyperparameters are
the same as reported in the papers introducing the mod-
els [67, 17, 65], with the exception of using a cosine learn-
ing decay for the Wide-ResNet-28-10. We then use the
same model and hyperparameters to evaluate the test set
accuracy of AutoAugment. For AmoebaNets, we use the
same hyperparameters that were used in [48] for both base-
line augmentation and AutoAugment. As can be seen from
the table, we achieve an error rate of 1.5% with the Shake-
Drop [65] model, which is 0.6% better than the state-of-the-
art [48]. Notice that this gain is much larger than the pre-
vious gains obtained by AmoebaNet-B against ShakeDrop
(+0.2%), and by ShakeDrop against Shake-Shake (+0.2%).
Ref. [68] reports an improvement of 1.1% for a Wide-
ResNet-28-10 model trained on CIFAR-10.

We also evaluate our best model trained with AutoAug-
ment on a recently proposed CIFAR-10 test set [50]. Recht
et al. [50] report that Shake-Shake (26 2x64d) + Cutout per-
forms best on this new dataset, with an error rate of 7.0%
(4.1% higher relative to error rate on the original CIFAR-
10 test set). Furthermore, PyramidNet+ShakeDrop achieves
an error rate of 7.7% on the new dataset (4.6% higher rel-
ative to the original test set). Our best model, Pyramid-
Net+ShakeDrop trained with AutoAugment achieves an er-
ror rate of 4.4% (2.9% higher than the error rate on the orig-
inal set). Compared to other models evaluated on this new
dataset, our model exhibits a signiﬁcantly smaller drop in
accuracy.

CIFAR-100 Results. We also train models on CIFAR-
100 with the same AutoAugment policy found on reduced-
CIFAR-10; results are shown in Table 2. Again, we achieve
the state-of-art result on this dataset, beating the previ-
ous record of 12.19% error rate by ShakeDrop regulariza-
tion [65].

Finally, we apply the same AutoAugment policy to train
models on reduced CIFAR-10 (the same 4,000 example
training set that we use to ﬁnd the best policy). Similar
to the experimental convention used by the semi-supervised
learning community [60, 40, 51, 31, 44] we train on 4,000
labeled samples. But we do not use the 46,000 unlabeled
samples during training. Our results shown in Table 2. We
note that the improvement in accuracy due to AutoAugment

is more signiﬁcant on the reduced dataset compared to the
full dataset. As the size of the training set grows, we ex-
pect that the effect of data-augmentation will be reduced.
However, in the next sections we show that even for larger
datasets like SVHN and ImageNet, AutoAugment can still
lead to improvements in generalization accuracy.

SVHN Results We experimented with the SVHN
dataset [42], which has 73,257 training examples (also
called “core training set”), and 531,131 additional training
examples. The test set has 26,032 examples. To save time
during the search, we created a reduced SVHN dataset of
1,000 examples sampled randomly from the core training
set. We use AutoAugment to ﬁnd the best policies. The
model architecture and training procedure of the child mod-
els are identical to the above experiments with CIFAR-10.

The policies picked on SVHN are different than the
transformations picked on CIFAR-10. For example, the
most commonly picked transformations on SVHN are In-
vert, Equalize, ShearX/Y, and Rotate. As mentioned above,
the transformation Invert is almost never used on CIFAR-
10, yet it is very common in successful SVHN policies. In-
tuitively, this makes sense since the speciﬁc color of num-
bers is not as important as the relative color of the number
and its background. Furthermore, geometric transforma-
tions ShearX/Y are two of the most popular transformations
on SVHN. This also can be understood by general proper-
ties of images in SVHN: house numbers are often naturally
sheared and skewed in the dataset, so it is helpful to learn
the invariance to such transformations via data augmenta-
tion. Five successful sub-policies are visualized on SVHN
examples in Figure 2.

After the end of the search, we concatenate the 5 best
policies and apply them to train architectures that already
perform well on SVHN using standard augmentation poli-
cies. For full training, we follow the common procedure
mentioned in the Wide-ResNet paper [67] of using the core
training set and the extra data. The validation set is con-
structed by setting aside the last 7325 samples of the train-
ing set. We tune the weight decay and learning rate on
the validation set performance. Other hyperparameters and
training details are identical to the those in the papers intro-
ducing the models [67, 17]. One exception is that we trained
the Shake-Shake model only for 160 epochs (as opposed to
1,800), due to the large size of the full SVHN dataset. Base-
line pre-processing involves standardizing the data and ap-
plying Cutout with a region size of 20x20 pixels, following
the procedure outlined in [12]. AutoAugment results com-
bine the baseline pre-processing with the policy learned on
SVHN. One exception is that we do not use Cutout on re-
duced SVHN as it lowers the accuracy signiﬁcantly. The
summary of the results in this experiment are shown in Ta-
ble 2. As can be seen from the table, we achieve state-of-

the-art accuracy using both models.

We also test the best policies on reduced SVHN (the
same 1,000 example training set where the best policies are
found). AutoAugment results on the reduced set are again
comparable to the leading semi-supervised methods, which
range from 5.42% to 3.86% [40]. (see Table 2). We see
again that AutoAugment leads to more signiﬁcant improve-
ments on the reduced dataset than the full dataset.

4.2. ImageNet Results

Similar to above experiments, we use a reduced subset
of the ImageNet training set, with 120 classes (randomly
chosen) and 6,000 samples, to search for policies. We train
a Wide-ResNet 40-2 using cosine decay for 200 epochs. A
weight decay of 10−5 was used along with a learning rate
of 0.1. The best policies found on ImageNet are similar to
those found on CIFAR-10, focusing on color-based trans-
formations. One difference is that a geometric transforma-
tion, Rotate, is commonly used on ImageNet policies. One
of the best policies is visualized in Figure 3.

Figure 3. One of the successful policies on ImageNet. As de-
scribed in the text, most of the policies found on ImageNet used
color-based transformations.

Again, we combine the 5 best policies for a total of 25

sub-policies to create the ﬁnal policy for ImageNet train-
ing. We then train on the full ImageNet from scratch with
this policy using the ResNet-50 and ResNet-200 models
for 270 epochs. We use a batch size of 4096 and a learn-
ing rate of 1.6. We decay the learning rate by 10-fold at
epochs 90, 180, and 240. For baseline augmentation, we
use the standard Inception-style pre-processing which in-
volves scaling pixel values to [-1,1], horizontal ﬂips with
50% probability, and random distortions of colors [22, 59].
For models trained with AutoAugment, we use the base-
line pre-processing and the policy learned on ImageNet. We
ﬁnd that removing the random distortions of color does not
change the results for AutoAugment.

Higher is better. ResNet-50 with baseline augmentation result is
taken from [20]. AmoebaNet-B,C results with Inception-style pre-
processing are replicated in our experiments and match the previ-
ously reported result by [48]. There exists a better result of 85.4%
Top-1 error rate [37] but their method makes use of a large amount
of weakly labeled extra data. Ref. [68] reports an improvement of
1.5% for a ResNet-50 model.

Our ImageNet results are shown in Table 3. As can
be seen from the results, AutoAugment improves over
the widely-used Inception Pre-processing [59] across a
wide range of models, from ResNet-50 to the state-of-art
AmoebaNets [48]. Secondly, applying AutoAugment to
AmoebaNet-C improves its top-1 and top-5 accuracy from

118

83.1% / 96.1% to 83.5% / 96.5%. This improvement is re-
markable given that the best augmentation policy was dis-
covered on 5,000 images. We expect the results to be even
better when more compute is available so that AutoAug-
ment can use more images to discover even better augmen-
tation policies. The accuracy of 83.5% / 96.5% is also the
new state-of-art top-1/top-5 accuracy on this dataset (with-
out multicrop / ensembling).

4.3. The Transferability of Learned Augmentation

policies to Other Datasets

In the above, we applied AutoAugment directly to
ﬁnd augmentation policies on the dataset of
interest
(AutoAugment-direct). In many cases, such application of
AutoAugment can be resource-intensive. Here we seek to
understand if it is possible to transfer augmentation policies
from one dataset to another (which we call AutoAugment-
transfer). If such transfer happens naturally, the resource
requirements won’t be as intensive as applying AutoAug-
ment directly. Also if such transfer happens naturally, we
also have clear evidence that AutoAugment does not “over-
ﬁt” to the dataset of interest and that AutoAugment indeed
ﬁnds generic transformations that can be applied to all kinds
of problems.

To evaluate the transferability of the policy found on Im-
ageNet, we use the same policy that is learned on ImageNet
(and used for the results on Table 3) on ﬁve FGVC datasets
with image size similar to ImageNet. These datasets are
challenging as they have relatively small sets of training ex-
amples while having a large number of classes.

Table 4. Test set Top-1 error rates (%) on FGVC datasets for
Inception v4 models trained from scratch with and without
AutoAugment-transfer. Lower rates are better. AutoAugment-
transfer results use the policy found on ImageNet. Baseline mod-
els used Inception pre-processing.

For all of the datasets listed in Table 4, we train a In-
ception v4 [58] for 1,000 epochs, using a cosine learning
rate decay with one annealing cycle. The learning rate and
weight decay are chosen based on the validation set perfor-
mance. We then combine the training set and the validation
set and train again with the chosen hyperparameters. The
image size is set to 448x448 pixels. The policies found on
ImageNet improve the generalization accuracy of all of the

FGVC datasets signiﬁcantly. To the best of our knowledge,
our result on the Stanford Cars dataset is the lowest error
rate achieved on this dataset although we train the network
weights from scratch. Previous state-of-the-art ﬁne-tuned
pre-trained weights on ImageNet and used deep layer ag-
gregation to attain a 5.9% error rate [66].

5. Discussion

In this section, we compare our search to previous at-
tempts at automated data augmentation methods. We also
discuss the dependence of our results on some of the de-
sign decisions we have made through several ablation ex-
periments.

AutoAugment vs. other automated data augmenta-
tion methods: Most notable amongst many previous data
augmentation methods is the work of [47]. The setup in [47]
is similar to GANs [18]: a generator learns to propose
augmentation policy (a sequence of image processing op-
erations) such that the augmented images can fool a dis-
criminator. The difference of our method to theirs is that
our method tries to optimize classiﬁcation accuracy directly
whereas their method just tries to make sure the augmented
images are similar to the current training images.

To make the comparison fair, we carried out experiments
similar to that described in [47]. We trained a ResNet-32
and a ResNet-56 using the same policy from Section 4.1, to
compare our method to the results from [47]. By training
a ResNet-32 with Baseline data augmentation, we achieve
the same error as [47] did with ResNet-56 (called Heur.
in [47]). For this reason, we trained both a ResNet-32 and
a ResNet-56. We show that for both models, AutoAugment
leads to higher improvement (∼3.0%).

Relation between training steps and number of sub-
policies: An important aspect of our work is the stochastic
application of sub-policies during training. Every image is
only augmented by one of the many sub-policies available
in each mini-batch, which itself has further stochasticity
since each transformation has a probability of application
associated with it. We ﬁnd that this stochasticity requires a
certain number of epochs per sub-policy for AutoAugment
to be effective. Since the child models are each trained with
5 sub-policies, they need to be trained for more than 80-100

119

epochs before the model can fully beneﬁt from all of the
sub-policies. This is the reason we choose to train our child
models for 120 epochs. Each sub-policy needs to be applied
a certain number of times before the model beneﬁts from
it. After the policy is learned, the full model is trained for
longer (e.g. 1800 epochs for Shake-Shake on CIFAR-10,
and 270 epochs for ResNet-50 on ImageNet), which allows
us to use more sub-policies.

Transferability across datasets and architectures: It
is important to note that the policies described above trans-
fer well to many model architectures and datasets. For
example, the policy learned on Wide-ResNet-40-2 and re-
duced CIFAR-10 leads to the improvements described on
all of the other model architectures trained on full CIFAR-
10 and CIFAR-100. Similarly, a policy learned on Wide-
ResNet-40-2 and reduced ImageNet leads to signiﬁcant im-
provements on Inception v4 trained on FGVC datasets that
have different data and class distributions. AutoAugment
policies are never found to hurt the performance of models
even if they are learned on a different dataset, which is not
the case for Cutout on reduced SVHN (Table 2). We present
the best policy on ImageNet and SVHN in the Appendix,
which can hopefully help researchers improve their gener-
alization accuracy on relevant image classiﬁcation tasks.

Despite the observed transferability, we ﬁnd that policies
learned on data distributions closest to the target yield the
best performance: when training on SVHN, using the best
policy learned on reduced CIFAR-10 does slightly improve
generalization accuracy compared to the baseline augmen-
tation, but not as signiﬁcantly as applying the SVHN-
learned policy.

5.1. Ablation experiments

Changing the number of sub-policies: Our hypothesis
is that as we increase the number of sub-policies, the neural
network is trained on the same points with a greater diver-
sity of augmentation, which should increase the generaliza-
tion accuracy. To test this hypothesis, we investigate the
average validation accuracy of fully-trained Wide-ResNet-
28-10 models on CIFAR-10 as a function of the number
of sub-policies used in training. We randomly select sub-
policy sets from a pool of 500 good sub-policies, and train
the Wide-ResNet-28-10 model for 200 epochs with each of
these sub-policy sets. For each set size, we sampled sub-
policies ﬁve different times for better statistics. The train-
ing details of the model are the same as above for Wide-
ResNet-28-10 trained on CIFAR-10. Figure 4 shows the
average validation set accuracy as a function of the number
of sub-policies used in training, conﬁrming that the valida-
tion accuracy improves with more sub-policies up to about
20 sub-policies.

Randomizing the probabilities and magnitudes in the
augmentation policy: We take the AutoAugment policy on

Figure 4. Validation error (averaged over 5 runs) of Wide-ResNet-
28-10 trained on CIFAR-10 as a function of number of randomly
selected sub-policies (out of a pool of 500 good sub-policies) used
in training with AutoAugment. Bars represent the range of valida-
tion errors for each number.

CIFAR-10 and randomize the probabilities and magnitudes
of each operation in it. We train a Wide-ResNet-28-10 [67],
using the same training procedure as before, for 20 different
instances of the randomized probabilities and magnitudes.
We ﬁnd the average error to be 3.0% (with a standard devi-
ation of 0.1%), which is 0.4% worse than the result achieved
with the original AutoAugment policy (see Table 2).

Performance of random policies: Next, we randomize
the whole policy, the operations as well as the probabilities
and magnitudes. Averaged over 20 runs, this experiment
yields an average accuracy of 3.1% (with a standard devi-
ation of 0.1%), which is slightly worse than randomizing
only the probabilities and magnitudes. The best random
policy achieves achieves an error of 3.0% (when average
over 5 independent runs). This shows that even AutoAug-
ment with randomly sampled policy leads to appreciable
improvements.

The ablation experiments indicate that even data aug-
mentation policies that are randomly sampled from our
search space can lead to improvements on CIFAR-10 over
the baseline augmentation policy. However, the improve-
ments exhibited by random policies are less than those
shown by the AutoAugment policy (2.6% ± 0.1% vs.
3.0% ± 0.1% error rate). Furthermore, the probability and
magnitude information learned within the AutoAugment
policy seem to be important, as its effectiveness is reduced
signiﬁcantly when those parameters are randomized. We
emphasize again that we trained our controller using RL out
of convenience, augmented random search and evolutionary
strategies can be used just as well. The main contribution
of this paper is in our approach to data augmentation and
in the construction of the search space; not in discrete opti-
mization methodology.
